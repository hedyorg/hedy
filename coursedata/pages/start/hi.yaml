-   title: What is a gradual programming language?
    text: "Learning to program can be hard. Not that programming itself *is* hard! But there are a lot of rules you need to memorize, just like when you started to learn English.\nSimilarly, you will need a lot of practice to learn programming.\n\nYou can read these sentences with ease. But do you remember when you were learning to read? You took some time then for each letter!\nThat is true for programming too, it might be hard in the beginning, but it will get easier!\n\nThe nice thing about Hedy is that Hedy is *gradual*. That means that you do not have to learn all rules at once.\nThe first few levels do not have that many rules, so you can get used to programming comfortably.\nIn every level we add new rules, increasing the number of commands that you know. Commands are instructions for a computer.\n"
-   title: Why is Hedy gradual?
    text: "In this video Felienne, the creator of Hedy, explains why Hedy is gradual.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"mx-auto mt-4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdqT313rM40\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"
-   title: Who is Hedy for?
    text: "Hedy is meant for all kids that want to learn programming! You do need to be able to read English with ease.\n"
-   title: Do I need programming experience?
    text: "No, that is not needed. However, if you have programmed with Scratch or Python, some commands will look familiar to you.\n"
-   title: Is Hedy free?
    text: "Yes! Leiden University allows us to share it for free. Hedy is also 'Open source', which means that everyone who can program can help us make Hedy better.\nYou can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy).\nIf you like Hedy and want to contribute, we do accept (and are very grateful for) [donations](https://www.steunleiden.nl/project/hedy)!\n"
-   title: Do I need to install anything?
    text: No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on your phone or tablet.
