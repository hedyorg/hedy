    Hi! On this page you can customize your class. By selecting levels and adventures you can choose what you student can see.
    You can also add you own created adventures to levels. All levels and default adventures will be selected by default. <b>Notice:</b> Not every adventure is available for every level!
    Settings up your customizations goes as follows:
steps:
    ["Select levels for your class by pressing the \"level buttons\"", "\"Checkboxes\" will appear for the adventures available for the chosen levels",
     "Select the adventures you want to make available", "Click the name of an adventure to (de)select for all levels",
     "Add personal adventures", "Selecting an opening date for each level (you can also leave it empty)",
     "Selection other settings", "Choose \"Save\" -> You're done!"]

    You can always change these settings later on. For example, you can make specific adventures or levels available while teaching a class.
    This way it's easy for you to determine which level and adventures your students will be working on.
    If you want to make everything available for your class it is easiest to remove the customization all together.
