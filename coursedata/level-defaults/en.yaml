    ## Welcome to Hedy!
    In Level 1 you can use the commands `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}`.
    Type your code in the programming field. Or press the green button in the example code block, and the code will be typed for you!
    Try the code yourself with the green 'Run code' button under the programming field.

    You can print text to the screen using the `{print}` command.

  example_code: |
    ## Example code
    ```
    {print} Hello!
    {print} Welcome to Hedy!
    ```

  intro_text_2: |
    You can also ask for input with `{ask}` and repeat it back with an `{echo}` command.

  intro_text_3: |
    Let's get started! Don't know what to create? In the next tabs you will find ideas for programs to build.
  example_code_2: |
    ## Example code
    ```
    {ask} What is your name?
    {echo} hello
    ```

  start_code: "{print} hello world!"
  commands:
    - name: "{print}"
      explanation: "{print} something with `{print}`."
      example: "Example: {print} Hello welcome to Hedy!"
      demo_code: "{print} Hello welcome to Hedy!"
    - name: "{ask}"
      explanation: "ask something with `{ask}`."
      example: "Example: {ask} What is your favorite color?"
      demo_code: "{ask} What is your favorite color?"
    - name: "{echo}"
      explanation: "repeat something using `{echo}`."
      example: "Example: {echo} so your favorite color is "
      demo_code: |-
        {ask} What is your favorite color?
        {echo} so your favorite color is
    - name: "{print} emojis"
      explanation: "print an emoji with `{print}`"
      example: "Example: {print} 🙋‍ 🌍 ❗"
      demo_code: "{print} 🙋 🌍 ❗"
    - name: "{forward}"
      explanation: "Draw a line with `{forward}`."
      example: "Example: {forward} 100"
      demo_code: "{forward} 100"
    - name: "{turn}"
      explanation: "turn the drawing turtle with `{turn}`"
      example: "Example: {turn}"
      demo_code: |-
        {forward} 25
        {turn} {left}
        {forward} 25
        {turn} {right}

    ## Variables
    In level 2 we learn two new commands: `{is}` and `{sleep}`.
    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a variable. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:

    This way you no longer need the `{echo}` command!

  example_code: |
    ## Example code
    ```
    name {is} Hedy
    age {is} 15
    {print} name is age years old
    ```
  intro_text_2: |
    `{print}` still works the same, but the `{ask}` command has changed. You need to use a variable in the `{ask}` command as well. It looks like this:
  example_code_2: |
    ```
    answer {is} {ask} What is your name?
    {print} Hello answer
    ```
  intro_text_3: |
    Another new command in this level is `{sleep}`, which pauses your program for a second. If you type a number behind the {sleep} command, the program pauses for that amount of seconds.
  example_code_3: |
    ```
    {print} My favorite colour is...
    {sleep} 2
    {print} green!
    ```
  start_code: "{print} hello world!"
  commands:
    - name: "{is}"
      explanation: "Give a word a name to use in the program using `{is}`. You can choose the name yourself."
      example: "Example: name {is} Hedy."
      demo_code: |-
        name {is} Hedy
        {print} welcome name
    - name: "{ask}"
      explanation: "ask something with `{ask}`. Beware! You need to give the answer a name with `{is}`."
      example: "Example: color {is} {ask} What is your favorite color?"
      demo_code: |-
        color {is} {ask} What is your favorite color?
        {print} color is your favorite!
    - name: "{sleep}"
      explanation: "Let Hedy pause for a (couple of) second(s)."
      example: "Example: {sleep} 2 "
      demo_code: |-
        {print} Let me think for one second...
        {sleep}
        {print} Hmm.. I need 3 more seconds...
        {sleep} 3
        {print} Eureka! Ive got it!
    - explanation: "Give a number a name using `{is}`. You can choose the name yourself."
      example: "Example: angle {is} 90"
      demo_code: |-
        angle {is} 90
        {turn} angle
        {forward} 100
      name: is - turtle

    ## Make a list!
    In level 3 you can make a list. You can let the computer choose something random from the list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy Code

    ```
    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
    {print} animals {at} {random}
    ```

  intro_text_2:
    You can also add items to the list with `{add}` and remove items with `{remove}`.

  example_code_2: |
    ## Example Hedy Code

    ```
    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
    {add} penguin {to_list} animals
    {remove} cat {from} animals
    {print} animals {at} {random}
    ```

  start_code: "{print} hello world!"
  commands:
    - name: choose_random
      explanation: Choose a random word from a group with `{at}` and `{random}`
      example: "Example: animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo."
      demo_code: |-
        animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
        {print} animals {at} {random}
    - name: "{add}"
      explanation: "add an item to a list"
      example: "Example: {add} dog {to_list} animals"
      demo_code: |-
        animals {is} cow, cat
        {add} dog {to_list} animals
    - name: "{remove}"
      explanation: "remove an item from a list"
      example: "Example: {remove} dog {from} animals"
      demo_code: |-
        animals {is} cat, dog, cow
        {remove} dog {from} animals
4:
  start_code: "{print} 'Hello world'"
  intro_text: |
    ## 'Quotation marks'
    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.

    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.

    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.

    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code
    ```
    print 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
    answer is ask 'What do we need to use from now on?'
    print 'We need to use ' answer
    ```
  intro_text_2: |
    ## Adventures are getting more and more difficult
    The adventures are now getting more and more difficult in the successive tabs.
    So it is best to start on the left with the story, and work to the right, in order to be challenged more and more.
  commands:
    - name: "{print}"
      explanation: "print exactly using quotation marks"
      example: "Example: {print} 'Hello welcome to Hedy.'"
      demo_code: "{print} 'Hello welcome to Hedy.'"
    - name: "{is}"
      explanation: "Give a name to some text and `{print}` without quotation marks"
      example: "Example: name {is} Hedy."
      demo_code: |-
        name {is} Hedy
        {print} 'my name is ' name
    - name: "{ask}"
      explanation: "ask something with `{ask}`."
      example: "Example: color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'"
      demo_code: |-
        color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'
        {print} color ' is your favorite!'
5:
  start_code: |-
    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'cool!' {else} {print} 'meh'
  intro_text: |
    ## If... else....
    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
    `{ask}` {and} `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
  example_code: |
     ## Example Hedy Code
     ```
     name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
     {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'
     ```
  intro_text_3: |
     ## Lists
     When we want to check if something is in a list, we can now use the `{in}` command.
     This code prints pretty! if you choose green or yellow, and meh otherwise.
  example_code_3: |
     ```
     pretty_colors {is} green, yellow
     color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'
     {if} color {in} pretty_colors {print} 'pretty!'
     {else} {print} 'meh'
     ```
  intro_text_2: |
     Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:
  example_code_2: |
     ```
     name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
     {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice'
     {else} {print} 'boo!'
     ```
  commands:
    - name: "{print}"
      explanation: "print exactly using quotation marks"
      example: "Example: {print} 'Hello welcome to Hedy.'"
      demo_code: "{print} 'Hello welcome to Hedy.'"
    - name: "{ask}"
      explanation: "ask something with `{ask}`."
      example: "Example: color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'"
      demo_code: |-
        color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'
        {print} color ' {is} your favorite!'
    - name: "{if}"
      explanation: "Make a choice with `{if}`"
      example: "Example: {if} color {is} green {print} 'pretty!' {else} {print} 'meh'"
      demo_code: |-
        color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'
        {if} color {is} green {print} 'pretty!' {else} {print} 'meh'
    - name: "{if} with turtle"
      explanation: "Make a choice with `{if}`"
      example: "Example: {if} answer {is} far {forward} 100 {else} {forward} 5"
      demo_code: |-
        answer {is} {ask} 'How far should I walk?'
        {if} answer {is} far {forward} 100 {else} {forward} 5
    - name: "{in}"
      explanation: "Check elements with `{in}`"
      example: "Example: {if} color {in} pretty_colors {print} 'pretty!' {else} {print} 'meh'"
      demo_code: |-
        pretty_colors {is} green, yellow
        color {is} {ask} 'What {is} your favorite color?'
        {if} color {in} pretty_colors {print} 'pretty!' {else} {print} 'meh'
6:
  start_code: "{print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5"
  intro_text: |
    ## 1 + 1
     In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

     The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

     The {times} is a bit different, because there is no {times} symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
     That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.
  example_code: |
     ## Example Hedy code
     ```
     {print} '5 plus 5 is ' 5 + 5
     {print} '5 minus 5 is ' 5 - 5
     {print} '5 {times} 5 is ' 5 * 5
     ```
  intro_text_2: |
     We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
  example_code_2: |
     ```
     name = Hedy
     answer = 20 + 4
     ```

  commands:
    - name: "{print}"
      explanation: "print exactly using quotation marks"
      example: "Example: {print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5"
      demo_code: "{print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5"
    - name: "{ask}"
      explanation: "{ask} for a calculation and check whether it is correct."
      example: "Example: answer {is} {ask} 'What is 10 plus 10?'"
      demo_code: |-
        answer = {ask} 'What is 10 plus 10?'
        {if} answer {is} 20 {print} 'Yes!' {else} {print} 'Oops'
    - name: "`{ask}` {and} `{if}` turtle"
      explanation: "{ask} the user how many angles they want"
      example: "Example: angles {is} {ask} 'How many angles?'"

        angles = {ask} 'How many angles?'
        angle = 360 / angles
        {forward} 50
7:
  start_code: "{repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'Hedy is fun!'"
  intro_text: |
    ## Level 7! Level 7!
    Level 7 adds the `{repeat}` command. {repeat} can be used to execute one line of code multiple times.
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code
    ```
    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'Hedy {is} fun!'
    ```
  commands:

      demo_code: "{print} 'Hello welcome to Hedy.'"
    - name: "{ask}"
      explanation: "ask something with `{ask}`."
      example: "Example: color = {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'"
      demo_code: |-

        {print} color ' is your favorite!'
    - name: "{if}"
      explanation: "Make a choice with `{if}`"
      example: "Example: {if} color {is} green {print} 'pretty!' {else} {print} 'meh'"

        color = {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'
        {if} color {is} green {print} 'pretty!' {else} {print} 'meh'
    - name: "{repeat} - turtle"
      explanation: "repeat a line of code with `{repeat}`."
      example: "Example: {repeat} 3 {times} {forward} 10"
      demo_code: |-
        {repeat} 3 {times} {forward} 10
8:
  start_code: |-
    {repeat} 5 {times}
        {print} 'Hello folks'
        {print} 'This will be printed 5 times'
  intro_text: |
    ## Indentation
    `{ask}` {and} `{print}` still work as you know them. But `{if}` {and} `{repeat}` have changed!
    You can now execute groups of code together, but you will have to *indent* the code.
    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code
    ```
    {repeat} 5 {times}
        {print} 'Hello everyone'
        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'
    ```

        else
            {print} 'pizza is better'
  intro_text: |
    ## All together now!
    In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` {and} `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!
    In the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.
    Give it a try!
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code
    ```
    {repeat} 3 {times}

    ## For each item in my list...
    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces.
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code
    ```
    animals {is} dog, cat, blobfish

  intro_text: |
    ## Loops!
    `{print}` works just the same but the we add a new form of the `{for}`. You can now write `{for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 5` and use `counter` in your program.
    Try it out to see what happens! Remember to use indentations after the `{for}` and `{if}` statements (That means starting a sentence with four spaces)
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code

    for counter in range 1 to 5
        print counter

  intro_text: |
    ## Numbers and texts
    **Decimal numbers**
    So far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers.
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy code
    ```
    {print} 'Two and a half plus two and a half is...'
    {print} 2.5 + 2.5
    ```
  intro_text_2: |
    **All texts need to be in quotation marks**
    For this level on you will also have to use quotation marks when storing a text with `=`:
  example_code_2: |
    ```
    name = 'Hedy the Robot'
    {print} 'Hello ' name
    ```
  intro_text_3: |
    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Iron Man'.
  example_code_3: |
    ```
    superheroes = 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Iron Man'
    {print} superheroes {at} {random}
    ```
  intro_text_4: |
    **All text after `{if}` comparisons need quotation marks too**
  example_code_4: |
    ```
    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
    {if} name = 'Hedy the Robot'
        {print} 'Hi there!'
    ```

    ## And... Or..?
    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two if's but can use `{and}` and `{or}`. If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

    ## Great, Greater, Greatest!
    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example `age < 12` checks if `age` {is} smaller than 12.
    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example `age <= 11`.
    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example `points > 10` checks if `points` is larger than 10.
    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example `points >= 11`.
    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
  example_code: |
    ## Example Hedy Code
    ```
    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
    {if} age > 12
        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
    ```
  intro_text_2: |
    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
  example_code_2: |
    ```
    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
    {if} name == 'Hedy'
        {print} 'You are coo!'
    ```
  intro_text_3: |
    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
  example_code_3: |
    ```
    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
    {if} name != 'Hedy'
        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
    ```

    ## More loops!
    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!
