That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. This also holds when you just want to create a block of one line. If you combine a repeat and an if, you will need to indent each block. Have a look at the example code for more details!"

      "`print` works just the same but the `repeat` is now replaced by `for`!
      You use `for i in range 1 to 5`, instead of `repeat 5 times`. You can also use `i` in your program!
