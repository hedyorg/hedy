# Rock, paper, scissors

In Level 2 you’ve learned to do something new. You can make lists and choose items from it.  This way you can create a game like rock, paper, scissors!
It works like this:

* `choices is rock, paper, scissors`
* `print choices at random`

# Create your own dice

You could also create your own dice. Take a look at the (board)games in your own home. Are there any games (special) dice? You can easily remake them with Hedy code. For example the dice in the game Pickomino has the numbers 1 through 5 and an earthworm.

You make the dice like this:

* `choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm`
* `print choices at random`

Can you make the dice as well?

# Who has to do the dishes?

Picking an item for a list doesn’t only happen in games. It can also come in handy if you want to let the computer decide fairly who has to do the dishes or change the kitty litter.
You can program that too now!

You can make this code:

* `people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie`
* `print people at random`

# A better storyl

In level 2 you could also upgrade your story, because the main character’s name can be anywhere in the line now! It only takes a little bit more of programming.


## Example
This is my story. The name of the main character that you choose will appear in the place where it now says name.

* The main character of the story is name
* name is walking through a forest
* naam is a bit scared
* Everywhere around him are strange noises
* naam is afraid this is a haunted forest

## Assingment

Your turn!

1. Write a short story about your main character.
2. Instead of writing the main character’s name, write the word `name` (like the example)
3. You’re also allowed to write sentences without the word `name`
4. Translate your story to Hedy code, like this:

Line1: type: `name is` followed by your main character’s name.
For the following lines:
Type `print` and then the sentences you’ve thought of.

## Example Hedy code
* `name is John`
* `print name is walking through a forest`
* `print name is a bit scared`
* `print everywhere around him are strange noises`
* `print name is afraid this is a haunted forest`

## An interactive story
You can program that the name can be chosen by anyone by changing the first line. Change `name is John` into `name is ask Who is the main character?`
This way you can pick a different name every time without having to change your code!

## We have a small problem…!
Did you try to make a sentence using the word name? Like, `print my name is name`.
If you hadn’t yet, go try it! You’ll see it doesn’t work right. Hedy will say: My John is John. Level 3 has a solution for that, so if you’re done with these exercises go check out level 3!
