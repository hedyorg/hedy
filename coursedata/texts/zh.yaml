HedyErrorMessages:
    Wrong Level: "这个 Hedy代码是正确的，但级别不对.你在第{original_level}级使用的是第{working_level}级的代码."

    Invalid: "{invalid_command} 不是一个第{level}级的 Hedy命令. 你编写的是{guessed_command}吗?"
    Invalid Space: "糟糕!你在第{line_number}行句首空了一格. 这个空格让计算机产生了困惑，你能不能删除这个空格?"

    Empty Program: You created an empty program. Type Hedy code in the left field and try again
    ask_needs_var: "Starting in level 2, ask needs to be used with a variable and quotation marks. Example: name is ask 'What are you called?'"
    Has Blanks: Your code is incomplete. It contains blanks that you have to replace with code.
    Unquoted Equality Check: If you want to check if a variable is equal to multiple words, the words should be surrounded by quotation marks!
    Unquoted Assignment: ' From this level, you need to place texts to the right of the `is` between quotes. You forgot that for the text {text}.'
    Cyclic Var Definition: The name {variable} needs to be set before you can use it on the right-hand side of the is command
    Lonely Echo: You used an echo before an ask, or an echo without an ask. First ask for input, then echo.
    Unexpected Indentation: You used too many spaces in line {line_number}. You used {leading_spaces} spaces, which is too much. Start every new block with {indent_size} spaces more than the line before.
    Locked Language Feature: You are using {concept}! That is awesome, but {concept} is not unlocked yet! It will be unlocked in a later level.
    Missing Command: It looks like you forgot to use a command on line {line_number}.
    echo_out: "Starting in level 2 echo is no longer needed. You can repeat an answer with ask and print now. Example: name is ask 'What are you called?' print 'hello' name"
    string: text
    No Indentation: You used too few spaces in line {line_number}. You used {leading_spaces} spaces, which is not enough. Start every new block with {indent_size} spaces more than the line before.
    Too Big: Wow! Your program has an impressive {lines_of_code} lines of code! But we can only process {max_lines} lines in this level. Make your program smaller and try again.
    Invalid Argument: You cannot use the command {command} with {invalid_argument} . Try changing {invalid_argument} to {allowed_types}.
    Invalid Argument Type: You cannot use the command {command} with {invalid_argument} because it is {invalid_type}. Try changing {invalid_argument} to {allowed_types}.
    Invalid Type Combination: You cannot use {invalid_argument} and {invalid_argument_2} in {operation} because one is {invalid_type} and the other is {invalid_type_2}. Try changing {invalid_argument} to {invalid_type_2} or {invalid_argument_2} to {invalid_type}.
    Unsupported Float: Non-integer numbers are not supported yet but they will be in a few levels. For now change {value} to an integer.
