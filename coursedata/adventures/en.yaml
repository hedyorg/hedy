                ## Make a story
                In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                As the first line, use this code:

                `ask who is the protagonist of your story`

                After that first line, start with `print` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                You use `echo` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                ask The main character of this story is ...
                print The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                echo He's a bit scared who ...
                print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                print He's afraid this is a haunted forest
                ```

                ## What's next?
                It is a pity that you can now only make sentences in which the main character is at the end of the sentence right? After practicing with this story, continue to level 2 and then to level 3, where you can make more and more complicated programs.

              start_code: "print Your story starts here"
          2:
              story_text: |
                ## Story in level 2
                In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                ## Example Hedy Code

                ```
                name is ask What is the name of the main character?
                print name is now going to run in the woods
                print name is a bit scared
                print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                print name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                ```

                ## Randomness
                You can also add something random to your story. Any monster, animal or other obstacle.

                It goes like this:
                ```
                animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                print He now hears the sound of an animal at random
                ```

                ## What's next?
                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word name?
                E.g. `print my name is name`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                That is not working properly! Then you get: my Henk is Henk. You can solve that in level 3.
              start_code: "print Your story"
          3:
              story_text: |
                ## Story in level 3
                You may have noticed that there is still a mistake in level 2.

                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word name? E.g. `print my name is name`.

                That didn't work well! Then you get: my Henk is Henk. You can solve that in level 3.

                You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                name is Hans
                print 'The name of the main character is' name
                print name 'is now going to walk in the woods'
                print name 'is a bit scared'
                animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                print 'He hears the sound of an' animals at random
                print name 'is afraid this is a haunted forest'
                ```
              start_code: "print Your sotry will be printed here!"
          4:
              story_text: |
                ## Story in level 4
                What you can do in level 4 is make your story even more fun. In level 4 you can program different endings.

                Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                - The princess is walking through the forest
                - She runs into a monster

                - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in level 3. You can combine that with an `if`, and then you have already made a whole program!

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                name is ask Who is walking in the forest?
                print name 'walks through the forest'
                print name 'encounter a monster'
                end is ask Would you like a good or a bad ending?
                if the end is good print name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away' else print 'The monster eats' name
                ```
              start_code: "print Hier komt straks jouw verhaal!"
          5:
              story_text: |
                ## Story in level 5
                In story, someone says words several times. For example when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                You can put such repetition in your story in level 5 with 'repeat'.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                print 'The prince kept calling for help'
                repeat 5 times print 'Help!'
                print 'Why isn't anyone helping me?'
                ```

              start_code: "repeat 5 times print 'Help!'"
    songs:
      name: "Sing a song!"
      image: "songs.png"
      description: "Print a song"
      levels:
        5:
          story_text: |
            ## Songs in level 5
            Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

            Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
            Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
            Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
            Baby Shark

            You can make this song much shorter with a `repeat`! Can you finish the code?

            ## Example Hedy code
            ```
            repeat ... ... print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
            print 'Baby Shark'
            ```

            After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.
          start_code: "print 'Baby Shark'"
        6:
          story_text: |
            ## Songs in level 6
            Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based counting.
            For example in the well-known song 'bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

            ## Example Hedy code
            ```
            verse is 99
            print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
            print verse ' bottles of beer'
            print 'Take one down, pass it around'
            verse is verse - 1
            print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
            ```

            You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

            # Looking ahead
            In level 5 we learned to repeat 1 line with `repeat`, like this:

            * repeat 3 times print 'Baby Shark Tutududududu'

            But as you will see in this lesson, sometimes you want to repeat several lines together. This can be done with cutting and pasting, but that is a lot of work. In level 7 you will learn how to do that more easily.

    dishes:
        name: "Who does the dishes?"

              story_text: |
                ## Dishwashing program in level 2
                Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?

                Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in level 2!

                You first make a list of the members of your family. Then choose 'at random' from the list.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                people is mom, dad, Emma, ​​Sophie
                print people at random
                ```

                ## What's next?
                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word people?

                E.g. `print I chose from these people`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                That is not working properly! Then you get: I chose from [daddy, mom, Emma, ​​Sophie]. You can solve that in level 3.

              start_code: "print Who does the dishes?"
          3:
              story_text: |
                ## Dishwashing program in level 3
                With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing planning more beautiful.
                This time the sample code is not quite complete.

                Can you complete the code by entering the correct commands or characters on the dots?
                Every three dots must be replaced with one command.

                Tip: Don't forget the quotation marks!
                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                people is mom, dad, Emma, ​​Sophie
                print ... the dishes are done by ...
                print people at ...
                ```
              start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"

              story_text: |
                ## Dishwashing program in level 4
                With the `if` you can now make more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                Don't forget the quotes!

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                people is mom, dad, Emma, ​​Sophie
                dishwasher is people at random
                if dishwasher is Sophie print ... too bad I have to do the dishes ... else print 'luckily no dishes because' ... 'is already washing up'
                ```
              start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"
          5:
              story_text: |
                ## Dishwashing program in level 5
                With the `repeat` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be wahing dishes for the entire week.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                people is mom, dad, Emma, ​​Sophie
                repeat ... ... print 'the dishwasher is' ...
                ```
              start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"
          6:
              story_text: |
                ## Dishwashing program in level 6
                How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count that in level 6.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                people is mom, dad, Emma, ​​Sophie
                emma_washes is 0
                dishwasher is people at random
                print 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                if dishwasher is Emma emma_washes is emma_washes + 1
                print 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                ```

                Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                Do you make the code for the whole week?

                ## What's next?
                Now you have to copy and paste a lot, right? We will fix that in level 7.
                This level is the end of the washing up adventure! But there are still many adventures to be made in other levels, such as a calculator, an interactive story and a more complicated game.

                ## Dice in level 2
                In level 2 we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.

                Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.

                Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.

                For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                ![Die of earthworms with 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/felienne/hedy@24f19e9ac16c981517e7243120bc714912407eb5/coursedata/img/dobbelsteen.jpeg)

                ```
                choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                print choices at random
                ```

                ## What's next?
                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that included the word choices?

                E.g. `print I chose from the choices`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                That is not working properly! Then you get: I chose from the [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm]. You can solve that in level 3.

                This time the sample code is not quite complete. Can you finish the code?

                ## Example Hedy code

                print ... you threw ...
                print ... ... ... <- here you have to program the dialing
                ```

                ## Dice in level 4
                You can also make a die again in level 4 using the `if`.
                Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                throw is ...
                print 'you have' ... 'thrown'
                if ... is earthworm print 'You can stop throwing.' ... print 'You have to hear it again!'

                ## Dice in level 5
                You can also make a die again in level 5. With the `repeat` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.
                Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                repeat ... ... print ___

                ## Dice in level 6
                You can also make an earthworm die again in level 6, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.

                You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.

                This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                points is 0
                throw is choices at random
                print 'you threw' throw
                if throw is earthworm points is points + 5 else points is points + throw
                print 'those are' points
                ```
                Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.

                ## Looking forward

                Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                In level 1 you can start with a rock, paper, scissors  game.

                With `ask` you can make a choice, and with` echo` you can repeat that choice.

                ## Example Hedy code

                ```
                print what do you choose?
                ask choose from rock, paper or scissors
                echo so your choice was:
                ```

                ## What's next?
                Just repeating is of course a bit boring because the computer does not choose anything. We will make that ourselves later.

                ## Rock, paper, scissors

                In level 2 we can enter lists and choose things from them.

                You first make a list with `is`. Then you can let the computer choose something from the list with 'at random' (you say et ren-dom).

                For example, you can let the computer pick from rock, paper and scissors.

                ## Example Hedy code

                ```
                choices is rock, paper, scissors
                print choices at random
                ```

                You can use the `ask` again in level 2. Can you print your choice and the choice from the computer?
                Beware though, `ask` now works differently than in level 1. There must be a name in front of it.

                ## Looking forward
                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that included the word choices?

                E.g. `print I chose from the choices`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                That is not working properly! Then you get: I chose from the [rock, paper, scissors]. You can solve that in level 3.

                ## Rock, paper, scissors in level 3
                In level 3 we can further program rock, paper, scissors. But if you want to add text, you have to use quotation marks here too.
                Do you complete the code by entering the correct commands or characters on the dots?

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                choices is rock, paper, scissors
                print ... The computer chose: ... ... at ...
                ```
              start_code: "print 'Welcome to your own rock scissors paper!'"

                ## Rock, paper, scissors in level 4
                In level 4 we can determine who won.
                For that you need the new `if` code.

                Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                Then you can use `if` to see if they are the same or different.
                Will you finish the code?

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                options is rock, paper, scissors
                computer choice is ...
                choice is ask What do you choose?
                print 'you chose' ...
                print 'computer chose' ...
                if ... is ... print 'tie!' else print 'no tie'
                if choice is stone and computer choice is paper print 'computer wins'
                ```

                First fill in the correct code on the dots to see if it is a draw.

                Then copy the last line a few times and fill in all the different options correctly.

                Now you have finished your own rock, paper, scissors! It's still a bit complicated with all those different options, isn't it?
                We will make that a bit easier in a later level.

              start_code: "print 'Welcome to your own rock scissors paper!'"

                ## Calculator
                Now that you can calculate, you can also create a program to practice maths calculations. You can make up the calculations yourself, for example:

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                correct_answer is 11 * 27
                print 'How much is 11 times 27?'
                answer is ask Do you know the answer?
                if answer is correct_answer print 'good job!' else print 'Wrong! It was ' correct_answer
                ```

                ## Random numbers
                You can also let the computer do random sums of its own using random.

                This is how you choose a number of tables to practice, and from that you always get a different sum:

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                tables is 4, 5, 6, 8
                numbers is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
                table is tables at random
                number is numbers at random
                correct_answer is table * number
                print 'how much is ' table ' times ' number '?'
                answer is ask Do you know the answer?
                if answer is correct_answer print 'okay' else print 'mistake! it was ' correct_answer
                ```

              start_code: "print Welcome to this calculator!"
