# Hedy

Hedy is a gradual programming language aimed at teaching programming and teaching Python. It teaches using different levels. The first level just offers printing text and asking for input. This level is meant to introduce learners to the idea of a programming language, and the environment. From there, Hedy builds up to include more complex syntax and additional concepts.

A simple way to help out Hedy is to [help us translate Hedy](TRANSLATING.md) using Weblate! You do not need programming experience or knowledge to translate Hedy. Below the current status, help us complete a language, or add a new one.

I have an idea for what you should build or improve!
----------------------------------------------------

Great! We have multiple ways of monitoring ideas.

If it is a small fix, it is best to [make an issue](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/issues/new/choose). Issues are meant for things we know that we want to work on, such as:

* Error messages that need to be improved
* Crashes or bugs

If it is a new idea, [start a discussion](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/discussions/categories/ideas). Discussions are a place to chat about stuff we do not know if we want to work on yet, or we are not sure how to do, such as:

* New keywords
* New meanings for existing keywords
* Experimental improvements to the parser/transpiler

Please note that we want to be a friendly and welcoming open source project. If you submit an issue, refrain from saying things are "bad", or "wrong" or "broken". Assume that code that is there was made by people that do their best! Neutrally phrased messages are nicer for everyone. For example use "did not do what I expected", "appears not to work" or "could be improved". Also feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8yY7dEme9r) channel to discuss ideas, get in touch with us our show of your Hedy related creations.

Want to help improve Hedy?
--------------------------

We would love to have a few more programmers join the Hedy team as regular contributors! See how you can get started with contributing in our docs: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can follow the [Discussions](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/discussions) to stay up to date on things we are working on and considering. Full documentation including our design and design principles can be found [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)
