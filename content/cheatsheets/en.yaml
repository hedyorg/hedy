        {if} age < 13 :
            {print}('You are younger than me!')
-   name: Bigger
    explanation: We use the `>` to check if the first number is bigger than the second number.
    demo_code: |-

        {if} age > 13 :
            {print}('You are older than me!')
-   name: Equal
    explanation: We use the `==` to check if two things are the same.

        {if} answer == 25:
            {print}('That is correct!')
-   name: Not equal
    explanation: We use the `!=` to check if two things are not the same.
    demo_code: |-
        answer = {input}('What is 5 * 5?')
        {if} answer != 25:
            {print}('That is not correct!')
-   name: Smaller or equal
    explanation: We use the `<=` to check if the first number is smaller than or equal to the second number.
    demo_code: |-
        age = {input}('How old are you?')
        {if} age <= 12:
            {print}('You are younger than me!')
-   name: Bigger or equal
    explanation: We use the `>=` to check if the first number is bigger than or equal to the second number.
    demo_code: |-
        age = {input}('How old are you?')
        {if} age >= 14:

-   name: 'Keywords you have learned before this level'
    explanation: 'Warning! From this level on the syntax resembles Python syntax. This means that the keywords you have learned in the previous levels might not work! Check out the upcoming levels to learn how to do them the Python way!'

-   name: 'creating a list'
    explanation: Use square brachets to create a list, and use quotation marks around each item.
    demo_code: |-
        fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
-   name: 'choosing a specific item of a list'
    explanation: To get an item from a list we use [number] so fruit[1] means, get the first fruit from the list!
    demo_code: |-
        fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
        {print}(fruit[1], ' is the first thing on my list')
-   name: 'choosing a random item of a list'
    explanation: choose a random item of a list.
    demo_code: |-
        fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
        {print}(fruit[random], ' is my favorite')
-   name: 'add to or remove from list'
    explanation: Use quotation marks to the items you want to add to or remove from a list.
    demo_code: |-
        list = ['item', 'ietm_2']
        {add} 'item_3' {to} list
        {print}(list[3])
-   name: 'using the variable i'
    explanation: You can use variable i with a list as well.
    demo_code: |-
        fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
        {for} i {in} {range} (1,3):
            {print}(fruit[i], ' is item number ', i, ' on the list.')

-   name: 'using a function'
    explanation: You can use a function like this. Take a close look at the correct syntax.
    demo_code: |-
        {def} ask_age() :
            age = {input}('what is your age?')
            {print}('You are ', age, ' years old')

        ask_age()
-   name: 'using a function with arguments'
    explanation: Place the arguments you want to use in your function between the parentheses.
    demo_code: |-
        name = {input}('what is your name?')
        surname = {input}('what is your surname?')

        {def} ask_age(name, surname):
            age = {input}('what is your age?')
            {print}(name, ' ', surname, ' is ', age, ' years old')

        ask_age(name, surname)
-   name: 'using a function with a return value'
    explanation: Use `{return}` to use the return value outside of the function.
    demo_code: |-
        {def} calculate_score(answer, correct_answer):
            {if} answer == correct_answer:
                score = 1
            {elif} answer == '?':
                score = 0
            {else}:
                score = -1
            {return} score

        answer = {input}('Where can you find the Eiffel Tower?')
        correct_answer = 'Paris'
        score = calculate_score(answer, correct_answer)
        {print}('Your score is... ', score)
16:
-   name: '{while}'
    explanation: We can use the `{while}` loop with not equal.
    demo_code: |-
        answer = 0
        {while} answer != 25:
            answer = {input}('What is 5 times 5?')
        {print}('A correct answer has been given')
-   name: '{while} with > and <'
    explanation: We can also use the `{while}` loop with `<` and `>`.
    demo_code: |-
        count = 1
        {while} count < 3:
            {print}('We do this ', 3 - count, ' more times')
            count = count + 1
        {print}('We are done')
