    explanation: After `{print}` you need to use parentheses
    example: '{print}'
    demo_code: "{print}('hi!')"
-   name: '{range}'
    explanation: After `{range}` you need to use parentheses
    example: '{range}'
    demo_code: "{for} i {in} {range} (1,10):\n    {print}('Hello, times ', i)"
-   name: '{print} with var'
    explanation: With `{print}` you need to use parentheses and commas if you {print} more items
    example: '{print}'
    demo_code: "name = 'Hedy'\n{print}('my name is ', name)"
-   name: ask something with {input}
    explanation: Use `{input}` instead of `{ask}` to ask something
