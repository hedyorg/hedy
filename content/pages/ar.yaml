    -   title: What's Hedy?
        text: "Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).\nIn contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn't use code blocks but textual code.\nSo with Hedy you'll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises.\nThis way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way!\nHere you can watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) about the development of Hedy as a programming language.\n"
    -   text: "Hedy is developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).\nIt's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.\nStudents (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy.\n"
        title: Target audience
    -   title: How does Hedy work?
        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught.Each level contains a variety of exercises to practice to newly learned commands.\nThe exercises can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in classical instructions. The lesson plans for each level are included in this teacher manual.\nThe lesson plans and exercises are explained step by step, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers should be able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and exercises!\n"
    -   title: Devices
        text: "Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.\nThere's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!\n"
    -   title: The Hedy Community
        text: "All Hedy teachers, programmers and other fans are welcome to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8yY7dEme9r). This is the ideal place to chat about Hedy: we have channels where you can show your cool projects and lessons, channels to report bugs, and channels to chat with other teachers and with the Hedy team.\n"

    -   title: Creating a Class
        text: "As a teacher, you can create a class for your students. In this class you can see the students' accounts and their programs and you could monitor their progress.\nYou can also customize your class and choose which adventures are available for them. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.\n"
    -   title: Student Accounts
        text: "There are 2 ways to let your students join your class: You can let them make their own accounts or you can create accounts for them.\n\n**Students make their own accounts**\nYour students can go to the Hedy website and create their own accounts, just like you did. To get them into your class, they simply have to click the invite link.\nYou can find the invite link on the class page and send it to your students. Mind that your students have to be logged in to Hedy when they click the link, so make ot work smoothly.\n\n**You create accounts for your students**\nSometimes it's easier to create a whole bunch of accounts for your students yourself. This can be done by clicking the 'create student accounts' button and filling in usernames and passwords for them.\nThe students can login with the username and password that you chose. Afterwards, they can change their username or password if they'd like and they'll still remain in your class.\n"
    -   text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.\nUntil you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.\n\n**For non-English speakers**\nNot only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.\nThis way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own laguage. For example Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.\n"

        text: "Because you are now logged in, you'll see the blue banner with My profile and My programs.\nThese tabs exist for your students too. In My programs you can find all the codes that you've saved.\n\nYou can save your projects easily by giving your project a name in the white bar and pressing the green button Save Code.\nYou (and your students) can also share programs. These programs will be posted on our explore page, for everybody to see and use.\nIf you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.\n"

        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"

Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"

    levels:
    -   level: '1'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                solution_text: "Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.\n"
                solution_code: "print Hedy can print this!\n"
                error_code: "Hedy can't print this\n"
                error_text: "For example they type a sentence without using print.\n"
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                solution_text: "Remove the capitals.\n"
                solution_code: "ask Why does my code work now?\nprint Because I removed the capitals!\n"
                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals.\n"
                error_text: "Commands won't work if they are in capitals.\n"
        -   title: Students use echo without ask
            example:
                error_text: "Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.\n"
                error_code: "echo Your name is\n"
                solution_text: "Add an ask command to make it work.\n"
                solution_code: "ask What's your name?\necho Your name is\n"
        -   example:
                solution_text: "In level 1 we have to keep it at this:\n"
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!\n"
                solution_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho The best is...\n"
            title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
        -   example:
                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90\n"
                solution_code: "forward 100\nturn 90\n"
                error_text: "Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"
            title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doesn't exist"
            example:
                error_text: "Backward is not a command.\n"
                error_code: "backward 100\n"
                solution_text: "To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:\n"
                solution_code: "forward -100\n"
    -   sections:
        -   example:
                error_text: "Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.\n"
                error_code: "prinnt Don't make typos!\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.\n"
                solution_code: "print Don't make typos!\n"
            title: Students make typos in their commands
        -   title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
            example:
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_text: "In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.\n"
                solution_code: "order is ask What would you like to eat?\n"
                error_text: "In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.\n"
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command '
            example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                error_code: "answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!\necho\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                solution_code: "answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!\nprint answer\n"
        -   example:
                solution_text: "So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.\n"
                error_text: "In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"
            title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
        level: '2'
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students try to print whole lists
            example:
                solution_text: "To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.\n"
                error_text: "A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.\n"
                error_code: "groceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries\n"
                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text
            example:
                error_text: "This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n\nor\n\nanimal is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animal at random\n"
                solution_text: "Don't use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n\nor\n\nanimals is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animals at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget at in at random
            example:
                error_text: "Like in the example\n"
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random\n"
                solution_text: "This problem is solved by adding the word at.\n"
                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"
        -   example:
                solution_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nprint fruit at random\n"
                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                error_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nfruit at random\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
            title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command
        -   example:
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                error_text: "In a list items are seperated with a comma.\n"
                solution_code: "pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                solution_text: "After each item on your list, there should be a comma\n"
            title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
        -   title: Students try to use at random without a list
            example:
                error_text: "For example\n"
                error_code: "clubs is Manchester United\nprint clubs at random\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.\n"
                solution_code: "clubs is Manchester United, Bayrn Munchen, FC Barcelona\nprint clubs at random\n"
        -   example:
                solution_text: "There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.\n"
                error_text: "In the example below 'names' is not a list, but a variable. You cannot add anything to it.\n"
                error_code: "names is Jake\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
                solution_code: "names is Jake, Amy\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
            title: 'Students try to use add/remove without a list '
        -   example:
                error_text: "Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy has to know which list the item should be added to/removed from.\n"
                error_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice\nremove dice\nprint I love adventures at random\n"

                solution_code: "print 'Hello'\nmood is ask 'How are you?'\n"
            title: Students forget to use quotation marks on both sides of the text
        -   example:
                error_text: "It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. Else they might use the \"double quotes\" or the skewed one `.\n"

                error_text: "From this level on apostrophes are not allowed. They are often used in English when thyping contractions like you're, don't or what's.\n"
                solution_text: "You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.\n"

        -   example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"

        -   example:
                error_text: "It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. ELse they might use the \"double quotes\" or the `skewed one`.\n"
            title: Students use the wrong quotation marks
        -   example:
                solution_text: "You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.\n"

            example:
                solution_code: "repeat 20 times\n    print 'This is enough'\n"
        -   example:
                solution_text: "You can fix this mistake by adding quotation marks. This way the computer knows that the second password in `if password is 'password'` is a string value (so normal text) and not the variable name.\n"

-   title: "ماذا تعني لغة برمجة متدرجة؟"
    text: |
        تعلم البرمجة قد يكون شيئاً صعباً. ليس لإن البرمجة بحد ذاتها صعبة! ولكن لإن هناك الكثير من القواعد لحفظها، كما الحال عندما بدأت تتعلم لغة ثانية كالانجليزية مثلاً.
        على نفس المنوال، نحن بحاجة إلى كثير من التمرين لنتعلم البرمجة.

        أنت الآن قادر على قراءة هذه النص بشكل سهل. لكن هل تتذكر عندما كنت لا زلت تتعلم القراءة؟ كنت بحاجة الى مزيد من الوقت عند كل حرف!
        هذا أيضاً ينطبق على البرمجة، ربما تكون صعبةً في البداية، ولكنها مع الوقت ستصبح أكثر سهولة!

        الشيء المميز في هيدي هو أن هيدي لغة *متدرجة*. هذا يعني أنه لا يجب عليك حفظ كل القواعد مرة واحدة.
        في المستويات الأولى لا يوجد الكثير من القواعد لذلك يمكنك التعود على البرمجة بشكل أسرع وبدون عناء.
        في كل مستوى جديد نضيف قواعد جديدة، يزيد عدد الأوامر البرمجية التي تعرفها. الأوامر البرمجية هي تعليمات لجهاز الحاسوب.

-   title: "Multi-lingual programming"
    text: |
        While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as `for` or `repeat`, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 39 different languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a a new translation.
-   title: "لمن هيدي؟"
    text: |
        هيدي مخصصة لجميع الأطفال الذين يرغبون في تعلم البرمجة! تستطيع البرمجة باللغة العربية وكذلك باللغة الانجليزية اذا رغبت بذلك.

        لا، لست بحاجة إلى ذلك. في جميع الأحوال، اذا قمت بالبرمجة سابقا من خلال لغة البرمجة سكراتش Scratch أو لغة البرمجة بايثون python، فإنك ستلاحظ بعض التشابه في بعض الأوامر البرمجية.

    text: |
        نعم! جامعة لايدن (Leiden University) تتيح لنا نوفير هيدي بشكل مجاني. كما أن هيدي مصممة لتكون من البرمجيات "مفتوحة المصدر"، وهذا يعني أن أي مبرمج يستطيع مساعدتنا في تطوير هيدي للأفضل.
        تستطيع أن تجد كود هيدي على منصة [Github](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy).
        إذا أعجبتك هيدي وأحببت أن تدعمنا فنحن نقبل بإمتنان كبير [التبرع](https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg)!

        لا. هيدي تعمل على متصفح الانترنت، وهو البرنامج الذي تستعمله الآن لقراءة هذه الصفحة. ربما متصفح Chrome أو Edge أو Firefox. هيدي تعمل أيضاً على أجهزة التلفون المحمولة أو الأجهزة اللوحية.
