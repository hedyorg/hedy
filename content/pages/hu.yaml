        text: |
            A Hedy egy szöveges programozási nyelv, amelyet kifejezetten (fiatal) tizenévesek (10-15 évesek) számára fejlesztettek ki.
            A gyerekek programozási nyelveivel ellentétben, mint a Scratch, Hedy nem kódblokkokat, hanem szöveges kódokat használ.
            Tehát Hedy segítségével a diákok megtanulhatják, hogyan kell olyat kódot írni, mint amilyet az igazi programozók, de apró lépésekben játékos gyakorlatokkal.
            Így Hedy lépcsőfokként szolgálhat a valódi programozási nyelvekhez, mint például a Python, elérhető és többnyire szórakoztató módon!
            Itt látható egy [videó](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) a Hedy mint programozási nyelv fejlődéséről.
    -   title: "Célközönség"
        text: |
            A Hedy-t a felső tagozatos és középiskolás diákok szem előtt tartásával fejlesztették ki (10-15 évesek).
            Fontos, hogy a diákok jól tudjanak olvasni. Javasoljuk, hogy ne kezdj Hedy-vel tanítani, mielőtt a diákok nem érték el legalább a 3. osztály olvasási szintjét.
            A diákoknak (és a tanároknak) nincs szükségük programozási tapasztalatokra, mielőtt Hedy -vel kezdenének dolgozni.

        text: |
            Hedy szintekre van osztva, amelyek új parancsokat tanítanak. Minden szint különféle gyakorlatokat tartalmaz az újonnan tanult parancsok gyakorlására.
            A gyakorlatokat a diákok egyénileg is elvégezhetik, vagy használhatják hagyományos óravezetéssel. Az egyes szintek óraterveit ez a tanári kézikönyv tartalmazza.
            Az óraterveket és gyakorlatokat lépésről lépésre ismertetjük, hogy a kevésbé digitálisan tájékozott tanárok is tudják használni a Hedyt!
            Természetesen Hedy gondoskodik a kreatív tanárokról is, akik szeretnek saját óraterveket és gyakorlatokat készíteni!
    -   title: "Eszközök"
        text: |
            A Hedy webalapú, ami azt jelenti, hogy bármilyen böngészővel rendelkező eszközön (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge stb.) működik, így laptopok, chromebookok, táblagépek és még okostelefonok is alkalmasak a Hedy használatára.
            Nem kell semmit letölteni, mielőtt Hedyvel dolgozol, csak menj a webhelyre, és készen áll!

        text: |
            Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.
            This gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.
            We use this structure in our lessons:
    -   title: "Introduction"
        text: |
            You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?
            This way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.
    -   title: "Introduction of new concepts and commands"
        text: |
            The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.
            That's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.
            Especially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.
            Showing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').
    -   title: "Let's get to work"
        text: |
            Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.
            The following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.
            The adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.
            The last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.
            They don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.
            The example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.
            Stimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.
    -   title: "Quiz"
        text: |
            To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.
            The quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.
            Not every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.
    -   title: "Evaluation"
        text: |
            Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?
            How did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?
            Students are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.
-   title: "Frequently made mistakes"
    key: "common_mistakes"
    intro: |
        You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!
        Making mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!
        Especially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.
    levels:
    -   level: '1'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students forget to type commandos"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example they type a sentence without using print.
                error_code: |
                    Hedy can't print this
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.
                solution_code: |
                    print Hedy can print this!
        -   title: "Students use capitals when typing commands"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Commands won't work if they are in capitals.
                error_code: |
                    Ask Why does my code fail?
                    Print Because I'm using capitals.
                solution_text: |
                    Remove the capitals.
                solution_code: |
                    ask Why does my code work now?
                    print Because I removed the capitals!
        -   title: "Students use echo without ask"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.
                error_code: |
                    echo Your name is
                solution_text: |
                    Add an ask command to make it work.
                solution_code: |
                    ask What's your name?
                    echo Your name is
        -   title: "Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.
                error_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo is the best!
                solution_text: |
                    In level 1 we have to keep it at this:
                solution_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo The best is...
        -   title: "Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.
                error_code: |
                    forward 300
                    turn 90
                solution_text: |
                    In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.
                solution_code: |
                    forward 100
                    turn 90
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doens't exist"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Backward is not a command.
                error_code: |
                    backward 100
                solution_text: |
                    To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:
                solution_code: |
                    forward -100
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students make typos in their commands"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.
                error_code: |
                    prinnt Don't make typos!
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.
                solution_code: |
                    print Don't make typos!
        -   title: "Students forget that the ask command has changed"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.
                error_code: |
                    ask what would you like to eat?
                solution_text: |
                    In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.
                solution_code: |
                    order is What would you like to eat?
        -   title: "Students try to use the echo command. "
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!
                error_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!
                    echo
                solution_text: |
                    Use a varible instead.
                solution_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!
                    print answer
        -   title: "Students use a variable name or as a normal word"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.
                error_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi my name is name
                solution_text: |
                    So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi I'm name
        -   title: "Students use long variable names containing two words."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: |
                    chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?
                solution_text: |
                    Add an underscore.
                solution_code: |
                    chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?
        -   title: "Students might use two different names for the same variable"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: |
                    horse is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name
                solution_text: |
                    Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: |
                    name is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name
    -   level: '3'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students try to print whole lists"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.
                error_code: |
                    groceries is apples, milk, chocolate
                    print groceries
                solution_text: |
                    To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.
                solution_code: |
                    print apples, milk, chocolate

                    or

                    groceries is apples, milk, chocolate
                    print groceries at random
        -   title: "Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.
                error_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi my name is name

                    or

                    animal is rhino, bee, swan
                    print The best animal is... animal at random
                solution_text: |
                    Don;t use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi I'm name

                    or

                    animals is rhino, bee, swan
                    print The best animal is... animals at random
        -   title: "Students forget at in at random"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Like in the example
                error_code: |
                    birds is sparrow, seagull, robin
                    print birds random
                solution_text: |
                    This problem is solved by adding the word at.
                solution_code: |
                    birds is sparrow, seagull, robin
                    print birds at random
        -   title: "Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.
                error_code: |
                    fruit is apple, cherry, banana
                    fruit at random
                solution_text: |
                    Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.
                solution_code: |
                    fruit is apple, cherry, banana
                    print fruit at random
        -   title: "Students forget to use commas in their lists"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In a list items are seperated with a comma.
                error_code: |
                    pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni
                    print pizzas at random
                solution_text: |
                    After each item on your list, there should be a comma
                solution_code: |
                    pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni
                    print pizzas at random
        -   title: "Students try to use at random without a list."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example
                error_code: |
                    clubs is Manchester United
                    print clubs at random
                solution_text: |
                    Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.
                solution_code: |

        -   title: "Students try to use add/remove without a list "
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In the example below 'names' is not a list, but a variable. You cannot add anything to it.
                error_code: |
                    names is Jake
                    your_name is ask Who are you?
                    add your_name to names
                    print names at random
                solution_text: |
                    There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.
                solution_code: |
                    names is Jake, Amy
                    your_name is ask Who are you?
                    add your_name to names
                    print names at random
        -   title: "Students forget to use to/from in add/remove."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.
                error_code: |
                    adventures is story, parrot, dice
                    choice is Which adventure do you like best?
                    add choice
                    remove dice
                    print I love adventures at random
                solution_text: |
                    Hedy has to know which list the item should be added to/removed from.
                solution_code: |
                    adventures is story, parrot, dice
                    choice is Which adventure do you like best?
                    add choice to adventures

    -   level: '4'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students forget to use quotation marks on both sides of the text"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level print and ask need a set of quotation marks. One before of the text and one after.
                error_code: |
                    print Hello
                    mood is ask 'How are you?
                solution_text: |
                    Add the correct quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    print 'Hello'
                    mood is ask 'How are you?'
        -   title: "Students use the wrong quotation marks"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. ELse they might use the "double quotes" or the `skewed one`.
                error_code: |
                    print `Welcome to the restaurant`
                    food is ask "What would you like to order?"
                solution_text: |
                    These are the correct quotation marks:
                solution_code: |
                    print 'Welcome to the restaurant'
                    food is ask 'What would you like to order?'
        -   title: "Students use an apostrophe in their text"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    From this level on apostrophes are not allowed. They are often used in English when thyping contractions like you're, don't or what's.
                error_code: |
                    print 'You're not allowed to type this'
                solution_text: |
                    You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.
                solution_code: |
                    print 'Youre allowed to type this'
                    print 'And you`re able to do this'
    -   level: '5'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students forget to use print in an if command"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    After students use if or else they forget to use a second command like print or ask.
                error_code: |
                    if name is Hedy 'Great!'
                    else 'Hedy is better!'
                solution_text: |
                    Add the print command to fix it.
                solution_code: |
                    if name is Hedy print 'Great!'
                    else print 'Hedy is better!'
        -   title: "Students might use two different names for the same variable"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: |
                    horse is ask 'What is your horse called?'
                    if name is Bonfire print 'cool'
                    else print 'less cool!'
                solution_text: |
                    Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: |
                    horse is ask 'What is your horse called'
                    if horse is Bonfire print 'cool!'
                    else print 'less cool!'
        -   title: "Students still forget the quotes on both sides."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    If commandos can get very long and students tend to forget to use quotes.
                error_code: |
                    if name is Hedy print fun
                    else print 'meh!
                solution_text: |
                    Always use 2 quotes in a print command.
                solution_code: |
                    if name is Hedy print 'fun'
                    else print 'meh!'
        -   title: "Students use quotes around variable names."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level there are no quotes around variable names.
                error_code: |
                    if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'fun'
                    else print 'meh!'
                solution_text: |
                    Remove the quotes to get the code to work.
                solution_code: |
                    if name is Hedy print 'fun'
                    else print 'meh!
        -   title: "Students use long variable names containing two words."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: |
                    chosen door is ask 'Which door do you pick?'
                solution_text: |
                    Add an underscore.
                solution_code: |
                    chosen_door is ask 'which door do you pick?'
        -   title: "Students want multiple answers to be correct"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example this student Hedy to tell all his friends that they are funny, but other classmates would be told that they are not.
                error_code: |
                    if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'You are funny' else print 'You are not funny'
                solution_text: |
                    You could use the `in` command for that. It is explained in a higher level, but it does already work in level 5.
                    Another solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny.
                solution_code: |
                    friends is Jesse, David, Souf
                    name is ask 'Who are you?'
                    if name in friends print 'You are funny'
                    else print 'You are not funny'

                    or

                    name is ask 'Who are you?'
                    if naam is Jesse print 'You are funny'
                    if naam is David print 'You are funny'
                    if naam is Souf print 'You are funny'
        -   title: "The students make the variable name the same as the value in the if statement"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In the example below the password is 'password'. This will result in it always being correct.
                error_code: |
                    password is ask 'What is the password?'
                    if password is password print 'Access granted'
                    else print 'Acces denied!'
                solution_text: |
                    Pick a different name for your variable.
                solution_code: |-
                    secret_password is ask 'What is the password'
                    if secret_password is password print 'Access granted!'
                    else print 'Access denied!'

-   title: "What is a gradual programming language?"
    text: |
        Learning to program can be hard. Not that programming itself *is* hard! But there are a lot of rules you need to memorize, just like when you started to learn English.
        Similarly, you will need a lot of practice to learn programming.

        You can read these sentences with ease. But do you remember when you were learning to read? You took some time then for each letter!
        That is true for programming too, it might be hard in the beginning, but it will get easier!

        The nice thing about Hedy is that Hedy is *gradual*. That means that you do not have to learn all rules at once.
        The first few levels do not have that many rules, so you can get used to programming comfortably.
        In every level we add new rules, increasing the number of commands that you know. Commands are instructions for a computer.
-   title: "Why is Hedy gradual?"
    text: |
        In this video Felienne, the creator of Hedy, explains why Hedy is gradual.

        <iframe width="560" height="315" class="mx-auto mt-4" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdqT313rM40" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
-   title: "Who is Hedy for?"
    text: |
        Hedy is meant for all kids that want to learn programming! You do need to be able to read English with ease.
-   title: "Do I need programming experience?"
    text: |
        No, that is not needed. However, if you have programmed with Scratch or Python, some commands will look familiar to you.
-   title: "Is Hedy free?"
    text: |
        Yes! Leiden University allows us to share it for free. Hedy is also 'Open source', which means that everyone who can program can help us make Hedy better.
        You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy).
        If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we do accept (and are very grateful for) [donations](https://www.steunleiden.nl/project/hedy)!
-   title: "Do I need to install anything?"
    text: |-
        No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on your phone or tablet.
