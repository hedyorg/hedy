  The Hedy Team understands how important privacy is to our community, especially kids and parents. We wrote this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our website, how we use, process, and share it, and what we're doing to keep it safe.
  It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your information, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.

  ## What personal information does Hedy collect about me?
  For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, such as your year of birth or your gender.

  ## Account Information
  In order to save programs, join classes, or share programs, you need to make an account. During account creation, we ask you for a username, your country, birth year, gender and your email address (or your parent or guardian's email address if you are under 16 years old).
  You are not required to share any of the above information with the exception of a username. We ask that you select a username that does not disclose your real name or other information that could identify you. Other users can see your username and country, but not your age, gender, or email address.

The results of this research are shared with educators and researchers through conferences, journals, and other publications.

For example, we use SSL/TLS for all data transfer and strictly limit access to the Hedy servers and the data we store on them.
