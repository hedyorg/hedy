-   title: Textual programming made easy!
    text: "Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to\nScratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.\n\nPython however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.\nHedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.\n\n1. Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language\n2. Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time\n3. Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience"
-   title: Multi-lingual programming
    text: While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as `for` or `repeat`, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 47 different languages, including Dutch, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a new translation.
-   title: Step by step learning
    text: Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!
-   title: Built for the classroom
    text: "Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.\nTeachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface."
-   title: Programming in context
    text: Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.
-   title: Is Hedy free?
    text: "Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.\nYou can find our code on <a href=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>.\nIf you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg\" target=\"_blank\">donations</a>!"
-   title: Do I need to install anything?
    text: No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.
-   title: Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?
    text: "No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.\nIf you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach\nand frequently made mistakes."

-   title: Teachers about Hedy
    text: "Various teachers worldwide have expressed their passion for Hedy, as some have shared with us:\n\n*Incredibly inspiring! Super good way to make programming a lot more accessible for yourself, but also for students. Very fun to play with and a lot of potential to use with the students. I think it is a very nice tool! I believe this is a valuable way for children to start learning programming. Python and coding have always been very exciting, because the barrier to learning is very high. Now everything is a bit lower and it was explained that it can actually be very easy. I enjoyed seeing how Hedy tries to make programming as accessible as possible for users!*\nNetherlands: Mathematics teachers in training (secondary school)\n\n*Simple interface and good examples.* Teacher: 3rd - 6th grades (elementary)\n\n*Multilingual programming and just the gradual programming concept itself.* US: middle school, 6th-8th grade\n\n*The gradual nature of introducing programming.* Australia: High school\n\n*Continues automatically.* Netherlands: 2 HAVO-VWO\n\n*Both that the explanation can be in Dutch (and the code in English), and that it builds up with more and more possibilities.* Netherlands: Plus class group\n\n*But Hedy and its gradual levels...what an idea, I wanted to personally thank you for creating this. I cannot thank you enough. Also, I have never seen the level of engagement and enthusiasm of my students, as I have seen with Hedy. We have covered till level 5, and plan to spend one more week on it in classes and labs, before starting Python.* Pakistan\n\n*The 'realness' of programming, it resembles how it is in reality.* Netherlands: Plus class group 4 to 8\n\n*Step-by-step activities. Fun activities.* Netherlands: 1e All levels, 2e VWO/HAVO 2e VWO +, 3e HAVO 3e VWO\n\n*I really like Hedy very much and it is also nicely set up, which makes it good to use in primary school. Hedy's gradual approach works very well. The short explanation at the beginning of each level and the short example programs help to give the children a quick insight into what is new in the chosen level. The different assignments that the children can choose also work very well. You see the children choose assignments that appeal to them and they then get to work with them, through the levels. Hedy is great fun for children who are good at programming and want to get a taste of a real programming language. It is good preparation for secondary school as soon as more ICT education is given there.* Netherlands: Oegstgeest Montessori school\n\n*The construction is so good.* Netherlands: Lower secondary school HAVO-VWO\n\n*I can keep the pace of the class.* Netherlands: group 7 en 8\n\n![Felienne teaching kids](/images/teacherfeedback/Fkids1.JPG) *Felienne teaching kids*\n\n\n![Kids learning about Hedy](/images/teacherfeedback/Fkids2.JPG) *Kids learning about Hedy*"

    -   title: What's Hedy?
        text: "Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).\nIn contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn't use code blocks but textual code.\nSo with Hedy you'll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises.\nThis way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way!\nIf you want to know more, you can watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> about the development of Hedy as a programming language."
    -   title: Target audience
        text: "Hedy is developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).\nIt's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.\nStudents (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy."
    -   title: How does Hedy work?
        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught. Each level contains a variety of adventures to practice the newly learned commands.\nAs a teacher, you get to decide which adventures are available for your students. Will they be making a restaurant, a calculator or a haunted house this level? Within each level, the adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest.\nSo your students keep getting challenged. The adventures can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in a classical instruction.\n\nThe adventures also include a code example, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers are able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and adventures!\n\nAfter programming all the adventures of a certain level, your students can test their knowledge in the quiz.\nYou can track your students' work and their progress on the class page."
    -   title: Devices
        text: "Hedy is web-based, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, Chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.\nThere's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!"
    -   title: The Hedy Community
        text: "All Hedy teachers, programmers and other fans are welcome to join our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/8yY7dEme9r\" target=\"_blank\">Discord server</a>. This is the ideal place to chat about Hedy: we have channels where you can show your cool projects and lessons, channels to report bugs, and channels to chat with other teachers and with the Hedy team.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyz_Lnd-_aI\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> you can find a video on how to join the Discord Community."
    -   title: Hedy and the GDPR
        text: "Organizations in the EU have to comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) when processing personal data.\nBecause this is a complex issue for many schools, you can use all Hedy programming functionalities without sharing personal data.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use Hedy without creating accounts for the teacher and students. Without accounts, all functionality is available, with the exception of personalizing levels, saving students' programs and viewing their progress. That is limiting, but there are schools that use Hedy in that way.\n\nA second way is for a teacher to create an account with an email address without personal data, for example \"docent25@email.com\". Apart from an email address, which is only required to reset your password, you do not need to share any information when you create a teacher account.\nWith a teacher account, you can create anonymous accounts for students, e.g. rainbow-student1, rainbow-student2, etc (See 'Teaching preparations' for a detailed manual). This way you can use all functionality of Hedy, including saving progress, without sharing personal data of yourself or your students.\n\nIf the above is not sufficient for your context, we can sign a processing agreement for the processing of your personal data."

    -   title: Duplicate a class
        text: "Are you teaching multiple classes? Then you don't have to customize each class individually. Simply make a class, costumize the class (see \"Customize your Class\" to learn how) and then duplicate this class as many times as you want.\nYou can duplicate the class on the 'For Teachers' page. If you duplicate a class, all the class settings are duplicated as well. This means that all the levels and adventures you've mande unavailable for the first class will now be unavailable for the new class(es) as well.\nThe student accounts and second teacher accounts in your class will not be duplicated into the new class."
    -   title: Add a second teacher
        text: "Are you not the only teacher that teaches your class? Then you can now add another teacher to the class. Go to the 'For teachers' page and click on the class. Then choose 'Invite a teacher' and fill in the username of your colleague.\nYour colleague will get an invitation on their account to join your class. They can see that invitation message by clicking on their username in the upper right corner of the screen and selecting 'My account'.\nOnce the other teacher accepts the invitation they can customize the class as well.\nTo remove a second teacher from your class, go to the class page and remove the second teacher. The teacher who's created the class cannot be removed."
    -   title: Customize your Class
        text: "You can customize your class and choose which adventures are available for your students. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.\nClick on your class on the for teachers page and choose 'customize class'. On this page you can select levels, set opening dates, unlock level thresholds and more.\n\n**Select and order adventures**\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/df38cbb2-468e-4317-ac67-92eaf4212adc\" width=\"1000\">\nIn this section you can select and order adventures. The pink tabs are adventures with new commands. The gray tabs are regular adventures. To rearrange the order of the adventures, you can drag the tabs. However, we do advise you to use the regular order of adventures as the Hedy team made sure the adventures go from easiest to hardest.\nIf you want to remove an adventure for your students, simply click the cross on the adventure's tab.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/0ddd10b5-ef60-4480-a0c4-fc9a0f323baa\" width=\"300\">\nIf you want to add adventures, for instance your own adventure or an adventure you accidentally removed, use this menu to add the adventure to your students' adventures. Simply click the adventure you want to add and it (re)appears in the line of adventures. To undo all your changes to the adventures, click 'Reset'.\n\n**Opening dates**\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/4e59acfa-4772-429f-8328-babb43c942d5\" width=\"300\">\nWith this feature you can set opening dates for the levels. This way you can make a lesson plan before your course begins and not worry about opening new levels each week. In the image above the first level is opened directly, the second will open the 23th of september, and the 3rd level the week after. The other levels are closed.\nDon't want to set opening dates? No problem, just leave this section blank.\n\n**Unlock level thresholds**\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/99a34dab-f112-459e-bfd1-07618be4715a\" width = \"1000\">\nThis featue allows you to set a threshold for your students' quiz grade, before they can continue to the next level. For example, if you enter \"80\" your students have to score at least 80% on the quiz before they are allowed to go to the next level. If they haven't met the threshold, they are not allowed to continue and have to retake the quiz.\nDon't want to use the threshold? No worries, just keep this section blank.\n\n\n**Other settings**\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/a8491d67-6d6e-42a7-b672-fd3d083a76f8\"/>\nThere are some other setting that could be usefu to you aswell. Our first extra setting is 'Mandatory developer's mode'. In developers mode the students only see their input and output screens and the run button. The adventures are hidden and there are no cheatsheets available. This might come in handy in a test situation.\nIf this option is not selected the developer's mode is available for students too as a voluntary option.\n\nIf you want all your students to be visible in de class highscore, you can select the second option.\nWith all the other options you can choose to hide some functions or content for your students, this might help them focus more.\n\n**Save**\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/df179df3-3073-4d15-bba6-62e58fb675be\" width=\"300\">\nDon't forget to save your changes when you're done customizing your class."
    -   title: Student Accounts
        text: "To add students to your class go to the class page by clicking in the class name on the 'for teachers' page. Then click 'add students'. There are 2 ways to let your students join your class: You can create accounts for them, or they could create their own accounts.\n\n**You create accounts for your students**\nThe easiest way to add students to your class is by creating an account for them. This can be done by clicking the 'create student accounts' button and filling in the usernames and passwords for them.\nThe students can login with the username and password that you chose. Afterwards, they can change their username or password if they'd like and they'll still remain in your class.\nThis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEQvik-Ce5M\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> shows how to add students to your class in the quickest and easiest way.\n\n**Students make their own accounts**\nYour students can also go to the Hedy website and create their own accounts, just like you did. To get them into your class, they simply have to click the invite link.\nYou can find the invite link on the class page and send it to your students. Mind that your students have to be logged in to Hedy when they click the link, in order to make it work smoothly.\nYou can also manually invite a student to your class with the button 'Invite by username'."
    -   title: Setting preferred language
        text: "When students create profiles they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigating to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.\n\n**For non-English speakers**\nNot only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.\nThis way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own language. For example, Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.\nIf a student wants to switch languages, they can click the keyword switcher. It will switch the keywords from English to the preferred language and back.\nFun fact! Students are allowed program in both English and their own language at the same time! So, if they have trouble remembering some keywords in English, but easily remember other ones they can use both at the same time.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/0b3122e6-ff22-43d7-b8b6-62f47f485293\" width=\"100\">\n\n**Video**\nThis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrVZETj4oLM\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> show you how to set a preferred language and change the keywords to you preferred language as well."
    -   title: Storing programs
        text: "When you are logged in, you'll see My programs next to your profile icon.\nThis option exists for your students too. In My programs you can find all the programs that you've worked on.\nBy default, programs will be saved to 'My programs' when you run the code, and every 10 seconds, under their default name\nand their level (for example: Story 5). If you want to store a program under a new name, just type the new name in the name bar.\nCurrently, only one program can be saved per level, per tab.\n\nYou (and your students) can also share programs using the share button next to program names.\nThese programs will be posted on our <a href=\"https://hedy.org/explore\" target=\"_blank\">explore page</a>, for everybody to see and use.\nIf you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.\n\nThe paper plane icon can be used to hand in programs to the teacher of a class. Programs that have been handed is will no longer be editable."

    subsections:
    -   title: Teaching with Hedy
        text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons: Introduction, New concepts and commands, let's get to work, puzzles and quizzes."
    -   title: Slides
        text: "When giving instructions you might want to use our slides. Our slides are available on the 'For teachers' page. There is a set of slides for each level. In the slides all the new commands for that level are explained. We have aimed to explain why these changes are nessecary or how the new commands come in handy.\nWe also give some examples of how the new commands can be used. You could of course also use your own slides, or just open Hedy and show your students around the website. Whichever you prefer to give the best Hedy lessons!"
    -   title: Introduction
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you start introducing the new lesson."
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience with programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog'). Our slides could help you with that."
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure."

        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them take the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\nSome levels also contain puzzles. Puzzles show the students a couple of line of code that the students have to put in the right order.\n\nThis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNh5EdZVUwc\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> shows the quizzes and puzzles."
    -   title: Evaluation
        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and give your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates."

The blue ring shows you what your students are currently working on.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/c7e2150f-60de-4ef7-8862-5901a7fb6609\" width=\"150\">\nIt is important to notice that the blue dots means that a students 'attempted' the adventure. This means that they ran a code in this adventure and went on to the next adventure, so this does not automatically mean that they did a good job!\nIf you want to see how an individual student is getting along, you can click their name in this overview. This is what you see if you click on marleen_h3a for example:\n<img src=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/f8c2480d-c724-46f9-a702-33532828de70\" width=\"800\">\nYou see that Marleen is having some trouble programming. She tried to run a program that contains blanks multiple times, so she probably doesn't know that she has to change something to the example codes before running them.\nIn this way this overview can give you a better understanding of what a student is struggling with."

    key: common_mistakes
    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions."
    levels:
    -   level: '1'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: For example they type a sentence without using print.
                error_code: Hedy can't print this
                solution_text: Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.
                solution_code: print Hedy can print this!
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                error_text: Commands won't work if they are in capitals.
                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals."
                solution_text: Remove the capitals.
                solution_code: "ask Why does my code work now?\nprint Because I removed the capitals!"
        -   title: Students use echo without ask
            example:
                error_text: Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.
                error_code: echo Your name is
                solution_text: Add an ask command to make it work.
                solution_code: "ask What's your name?\necho Your name is"
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!"
                solution_text: 'In level 1 we have to keep it at this:'
                solution_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho The best is..."
        -   title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
            example:
                error_text: Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.
                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90"
                solution_text: In the example, students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Even though it does work, you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.
                solution_code: "forward 100\nturn 90"
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doesn't exist"
            example:
                error_text: Backward is not a command.
                error_code: backward 100
                solution_text: 'To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:'
                solution_code: forward -100
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: Students make typos in their commands
            example:
                error_text: Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.
                error_code: prinnt Don't make typos!
                solution_text: Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.
                solution_code: print Don't make typos!
        -   title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
            example:
                error_text: In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.
                error_code: ask what would you like to eat?
                solution_text: In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.
                solution_code: order is ask What would you like to eat?
        -   title: Students try to use the `{echo}` command
            example:
                error_text: For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the `{echo}` command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!
                error_code: "answer {is} {ask} Why doesn't {echo} work anymore?!\n{echo}"
                solution_text: Use a variable instead.
                solution_code: "answer {is} {ask} Why doens't {echo} work anymore?!\n{print} answer"
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_text: In the example below the word 'name' is used as a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name"
                solution_text: So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name"
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?
                solution_text: Add an underscore.
                solution_code: chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name"
                solution_text: Always check whether the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name"
    -   level: '3'
        sections:
        -   title: Students try to print whole lists
            example:
                error_text: A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with {at} {random}.
                error_code: "groceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries"
                solution_text: To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a `{print}` command. Else you can use the list to print one item with `{at}` `{random}`.
                solution_code: "{print} apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries {is} apples, milk, chocolate\n{print} groceries {at} {random}"
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text
            example:
                error_text: This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.
                error_code: "name {is} Hedy\n{print} Hi my name is name\n\nor\n\nanimal {is} rhino, bee, swan\n{print} The best animal is... animal {at} {random}"
                solution_text: Don't use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solved with quotation marks.
                solution_code: "name {is} Hedy\n{print} Hi I'm name\n\nor\n\nanimals {is} rhino, bee, swan\n{print} The best animal is... animals {at} {random}"
        -   title: Students forget `{at}` in `{at}` `{random}`
            example:
                error_text: Like in the example
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random"
                solution_text: This problem is solved by adding the word at.
                solution_code: "birds {is} sparrow, seagull, robin\n{print} birds {at} {random}"
        -   title: Students forget to use the `{print}` command when also using the `{at}` `{random}` command
            example:
                error_text: Or they will sometimes put `{at}` `{random}` at the beginning of the line.
                error_code: "fruit {is} apple, cherry, banana\nfruit {at} {random}"
                solution_text: Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.
                solution_code: "fruit {is} apple, cherry, banana\n{print} fruit {at} {random}"
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_text: In a list items are seperated with a comma.
                error_code: "pizzas {is} funghi tonno quattro stagioni\n{print} pizzas {at} {random}"
                solution_text: After each item on your list, there should be a comma
                solution_code: "pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random"
        -   title: Students try to use `{at}` `{random}` without a list
            example:
                error_text: For example
                error_code: "clubs {is} Manchester United\n{print} clubs {at} {random}"
                solution_text: Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.
                solution_code: "clubs {is} Manchester United, Bayrn Munchen, FC Barcelona\n{print} clubs {at} {random}"
        -   title: Students try to use add/remove without a list
            example:
                error_text: In the example below 'names' is not a list, but a variable. You cannot add anything to it.
                error_code: "names {is} Jake\nyour_name {is} {ask} Who are you?\n{add} your_name {to} names\n{print} names {at} {random}"
                solution_text: There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.
                solution_code: "names {is} Jake, Amy\nyour_name {is} {ask} Who are you?\n{add} your_name {to} names\n{print} names {at} {random}"
        -   title: Students forget to use to/from in add/remove
            example:
                error_text: Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.
                error_code: "adventures {is} story, parrot, dice\nchoice {is} Which adventure do you like best?\n{add} choice\n{remove} dice\n{print} I love adventures {at} {random}"
                solution_text: Hedy has to know which list the item should be added to/removed from.
                solution_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice to adventures\nremove dice from adventures\nprint I love adventures at random"
    -   level: '4'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use quotation marks on both sides of the text
            example:
                error_text: In this level print and ask need a set of quotation marks. One before of the text and one after.
                error_code: "print Hello\nmood is ask 'How are you?"
                solution_text: Add the correct quotation marks.
                solution_code: "print 'Hello'\nmood is ask 'How are you?'"
        -   title: Students use the wrong quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. Else they might use the "double quotes" or the skewed one `.
                error_code: "print `Welcome to the restaurant`\nfood is ask \"What would you like to order?\""
                solution_text: 'These are the correct quotation marks:'
                solution_code: "print 'Welcome to the restaurant'\nfood is ask 'What would you like to order?'"
        -   title: Students use an apostrophe in their text
            example:
                error_text: From this level on apostrophes are not allowed. They are often used in English when typing contractions like you're, don't or what's.
                error_code: print 'You're not allowed to type this'
                solution_text: You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.
                solution_code: "print 'Youre allowed to type this'\nprint 'And you`re able to do this'"
    -   level: '5'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use `{print}` in an `{if}` command
            example:
                error_text: After students use `{if}` or `{else}` they forget to use a second command like `{print}` or `{ask}`.
                error_code: "if name is Hedy 'Great!'\nelse 'Hedy is better!'"
                solution_text: Add the print command to fix it.
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'Great!'\nelse print 'Hedy is better!'"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: "horse is ask 'What is your horse called?'\nif name is Bonfire print 'cool'\nelse print 'less cool!'"
                solution_text: Always check whether the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: "horse is ask 'What is your horse called'\nif horse is Bonfire print 'cool!'\nelse print 'less cool!'"
        -   title: Students still forget the quotes on both sides
            example:
                error_text: Codes using the `if` commando can get very long and students tend to forget to use quotes.
                error_code: "if name is Hedy print fun\nelse print 'meh!"
                solution_text: Always use 2 quotes in a print command.
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!'"
        -   title: Students use quotes around variable names
            example:
                error_text: In this level there are no quotes around variable names.
                error_code: "if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!'"
                solution_text: Remove the quotes to get the code to work.
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!"
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words
            example:
                error_text: A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: chosen door is ask 'Which door do you pick?'
                solution_text: Add an underscore.
                solution_code: chosen_door is ask 'which door do you pick?'
        -   title: Students want multiple answers to be correct
            example:
                error_text: For example this student Hedy to tell all his friends that they are funny, but other classmates would be told that they are not.
                error_code: if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'You are funny' else print 'You are not funny'
                solution_text: "You could use the `in` command for that. It is explained in a higher level, but it does already work in level 5.\nAnother solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny."
                solution_code: "friends is Jesse, David, Souf\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif name in friends print 'You are funny'\nelse print 'You are not funny'\n\nor\n\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif naam is Jesse print 'You are funny'\nif naam is David print 'You are funny'\nif naam is Souf print 'You are funny'"
        -   title: The students make the variable name the same as the value in the `{if}` statement
            example:
                error_text: In the example below the password is 'password'. This will result in it always being correct.
                error_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is password print 'Access granted'\nelse print 'Acces denied!'"
                solution_text: Pick a different name for your variable.
                solution_code: "secret_password {is} {ask} 'What is the password'\n{if} secret_password {is} password {print} 'Access granted!'\n{else} {print} 'Access denied!'"
    -   level: '6'
        sections:
        -   title: Students struggle with quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: Some students struggle with adding quotation marks or not. If you add quotation marks, the output screen will literally show '5+5'.
                error_code: print '5 + 5'
                solution_text: In this code the output screen will print '10'.
                solution_code: print 5 + 5
        -   title: Students struggle with the concept of doing maths with a variable
            example:
                error_text: 'Some students will find it hard to do maths with variables. Try to show them very simple examples, like:'
                error_code: "age = ask 'How old are you?'\nprint 'Next year you will be ' age + 1"
                solution_text: Or take it a step further like this.
                solution_code: "price = 0\nprint 'Welcome to our burger restaurant'\nburger = ask 'Would you like a burger?'\nif burger = yes price = price + 10\ndrink = ask 'Would you like a drink?'\nif drink = yes price = price + 4\nprint 'That will be ' price ' euros please'"
    -   level: '7'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget one of the word of the repeat command, or they forget the print command
            example:
                error_text: Make sure that the students know to use both the full repeat command and the print command.
                error_code: "repeat 3 times 'For he`s a jolly good fellow'\nrepeat 3 print 'Which nobody can deny!'"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "repeat 3 times print 'For he`s a jolly good fellow'\nrepeat 3 times print 'Which nobody can deny!'"
        -   title: Students try to repeat multiple lines
            example:
                error_text: In this level you can only repeat one line of code multiple times. In this code the student wanted to print 3 different drinks, but it won't work. It will ask the question 3 times and only print the last answer.
                error_code: "repeat 3 times drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\nprint drink"
                solution_text: You should go to the next level to be able to repeat multiple lines. So on this level you'll have to print everything seperately.
                solution_code: "drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\nprint drink\ndrink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\nprint drink\ndrink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\nprint drink"
        -   title: Students make programs that take too long to run
            example:
                error_text: In this level it's very easy to make long codes. The students aren't allowed to make programs that take to long to load (to save our servers).
                error_code: repeat 100 times print 'How many times can I repeat this?'
                solution_text: Make sure the codes aren't too long
                solution_code: repeat 20 times print 'This is enough'
    -   level: '8'
        sections:
        -   title: Students use the indentation wrong
            example:
                error_text: Indentation is a new concept in this level, that is hard to use for some students. Make sure they practise some simple codes before making a whole program with it.
                error_code: "repeat 3 times\nprint 'hello'"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "repeat 3 times\n    print 'hello'"
        -   title: Students only repeat 1 line when they wanted to repeat multiple lines
            example:
                error_text: For instance, in the code below the student wanted to take the drinks order of 3 people. But instead the program asked 3 times, but only wrote down one order.
                error_code: "repeat 3 times\n    drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\nprint drink"
                solution_text: "In the correct code the third line starts with indentation too. This way it belongs to the repeat block and therefore it will be repeated 3 times.\nShowing your students these differences can help them understand why we need indentation to make our programs work."
                solution_code: "repeat 3 times\n    drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\n    print drink"
        -   title: Students want to nest `{if}` statements, or put `{if}` statements inside a loop
            example:
                error_text: "In this level students aren't allowed yet to put `{if}` statements inside other `{if}` statements or inside repeat loops.\nIn the next level this is allowed."
                error_code: "birthday = ask 'Is it you birthday?'\nif birthday = yes\n    repeat 3 times\n        print 'Hip Hip Hooray!'"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code for this level:'
                solution_code: "birthday = ask 'Is it you birthday?'\nif birthday = yes\n    print 'Hip Hip Hooray!'\n    print 'Hip Hip Hooray!'\n    print 'Hip Hip Hooray!'"
        -   title: Students make programs that take too long to run
            example:
                error_text: In this level it's very easy to make long codes. The students aren't allowed to make programs that take to long to load (to save our servers).
                error_code: "repeat 100 times\n    print 'How many times can I repeat this?'"
                solution_text: Make sure the codes aren't too long
                solution_code: "repeat 20 times\n    print 'This is enough'"
        -   title: Students use the `{if}` command to check if the variable value is the same as the variable name
            example:
                error_text: "We have seen this mistake by some of our students. They make a password for their computer, but they make the password 'password'.\nIn line 2 the computer is asked to check whether the variable password is the same as the variable password, so itself. Which means the answer is always yes.\nSo with this code the answer will always be 'You can come in' no matter what the player fills in."
                error_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is password\n    print 'You can come in'\nelse\n    print 'You are not allowed'"
                solution_text: You can fix this mistake by adding quotation marks. This way the computer knows that the second password in `{if} password {is} 'password'` is a string value (so normal text) and not the variable name.
                solution_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is 'password'\n    print 'You can come in'\nelse\n    print 'You are not allowed'"

        -   title: Students make mistakes with indentation
            example:
                error_text: The hardest part about this level is getting the indentation right. Students love nesting `{if}` statements, sometimes even inside other nested `{if}` statements. Keeping track of indentation can get pretty tough.
                error_code: "print 'Robin is walking downtown'\nlocation = ask 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'\nif location is shop\n    print 'She enters the shop.'\n    print 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'\n    book = ask 'Does Robin buy the book?'\n        if book is yes\nprint 'Robin buys the book and goes home'\nelse\n    print 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'\nelse\n    print 'Robin goes home'"
                solution_text: This is the correct code. Try to keep track of all the different constructions when putting `{if}` statements inside other `{if}` statements.
                solution_code: "print 'Robin is walking downtown'\nlocation = ask 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'\nif location is shop\n    print 'She enters the shop.'\n    print 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'\n    book = ask 'Does Robin buy the book?'\n    if book is yes\n        print 'Robin buys the book and goes home'\n    else\n        print 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'\nelse\n    print 'Robin goes home'"
    -   level: '10'
        sections:
        -   title: Students do not use the for command correctly
            example:
                error_text: We often see that students try to print the list (in the example animals) instead of the items of the list.
                error_code: "animals is dog, cat, blobfish\nfor animal in animals\n  print 'I love ' animals"
                solution_text: The word animals in the last line should be changed into animal.
                solution_code: "animals is dog, cat, blobfish\nfor animal in animals\n  print 'I love ' animal"
        -   title: Students forget the indentation
            example:
                error_text: Students tend to forget to use indentation after a for command.
                error_code: "animals is dog, cat, blobfish\nfor animal in animals\nprint 'I love ' animals"
                solution_text: You should use indentation after a for command.

                error_code: "for i in range 1 to 5\nprint i"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "for i in range 1 to 5\n    print i"
        -   title: Students don't understand the i
            example:
                error_text: "Some students don't understand that i is a variable. i is chosen, because it is used in Python programming, but you could just as easily use a different variable name.\nFor example, this code:"
                error_code: "for i in range 1 to 5\nprint i"
                solution_text: Could just as well be replaced with this code. It works the same.

                error_text: Students need more quotation marks now than in the previous levels. In this example quotation marks were forgotten in the list and in the `{if}` command.
                error_code: "superheroes = Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man\nsuperhero = superheroes {at} {random}\n{if} superhero = Batman\n    {print} 'IM BATMAN!'"

        -   title: Students use quotation marks on numbers they want to use for calculations
            example:
                error_text: "You can use quotation marks on numbers, but only if you want the computer to think of them as text. This means you can't do calculations with the number.\nIn the example below, you can't do maths with the number 25, because it's in quotation marks."
                error_code: "score = '25'\nanswer is ask 'Do you want a point?'\nif answer is 'yes'\n    score = score + 1\n    print score"

        -   title: Students use the wrong signs for `!=` `<=` and `>=`
            example:
                error_text: These signs are probably new for most students. Make sure to explain these signs to your students.

                error_text: The `{elif}` command needs a condition behind it. It cannot be used like `{else}`, without a condition.
                error_code: "color = ask 'What is your favorite color?'\n{if} color == 'green':\n    {print} 'green is nice'\n{elif}:\n    {print} 'I like green'"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "color = {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'\n{if} color == 'green':\n    {print} 'green is nice'\n{elif} color == yellow:\n    {print} 'yellow is alright'\n{else}:\n    {print} 'I like green'"
        -   title: Students forget the colon
            example:
                error_text: After each command that requires indentation, a colon should be used.
                error_code: "answer = ask 'How are you doing?'\n{if} answer {is} 'great'\n    {print} 'Me too!'\n{elif} answer {is} 'bad'\n    {print} 'Let me cheer you up!'\n{else}\n    {print} 'Im great!'"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "answer = ask 'How are you doing?'\nif answer is 'great':\n    print 'Me too!'\nelif answer is 'bad':\n    print 'Let me cheer you up!'\nelse:\n    print 'Im great!'"

        -   title: Students forget to use the brackets
            example:
                error_text: Students will forget to put brackets around their text.
                error_code: print 'my name is Hedy!'
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: print('my name is Hedy!')
        -   title: Students will still use the ask command
            example:
                error_text: The ask command has been used since level 1. So it might be hard for the students to switch to input instead of ask.
                error_code: "print('My name is Hedy!')\nname = ask('What is your name?')\nprint('So your name is ', name)"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "print('My name is Hedy!')\nname = input('What is your name?')\nprint('So your name is ', name)"
        -   title: Students might use the brackets as quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: They have learned to keep the variables outside of the quotation marks, so they might do the same with the brackets. Which is not the correct way to use them.
                error_code: "temperature = 25\nprint('It is ') temperature ('degrees outside')"
                solution_text: 'This is the correct code:'
                solution_code: "temperature = 25\nprint('It is ', temperature, 'degrees outside')"
