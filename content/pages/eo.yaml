    -   title: Kio estas Hedy?
        text: "Hedy estas teksta programlingvo, specife fasonita por geadoleskantoj (10- ĝis 15-jaruloj).\nKontraste al programlingvoj por infanoj, kiel Scratch, Hedy ne uzas kodblokojn sed tekstan kodon.\nDo per Hedy vi lernos kiel tajpi kodon kiel faras veraj programistoj, sed laŭ paŝetoj kaj ludecaj ekzercoj.\nTiel Hedy povas funkcii kiel paŝoŝtono al veraj programlingvoj kiel Python en neteknika kaj plejparte amuza maniero!\nJen anglalingva [filmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) pri la evoluo de Hedy kiel programlingvo.\n"
    -   title: Celataj uzantoj
        text: "Hedy's developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).\nIt's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.\nStudents (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy.\n"

    -   title: Instruado per Hedy
        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught.Each level contains a variety of exercises to practice to newly learned commands.\nThe exercises can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in classical instructions. The lesson plans for each level are included in this teacher manual.\nThe lesson plans and exercises are explained step by step, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers should be able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and exercises!\n"
    -   title: Aparatoj
        text: "Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.\nThere's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!\n"

    -   title: Agordi preferatan lingvon
        text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My profile' and 'My profile' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.\nUntil you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.\n"
    -   title: Konservi programojn
        text: "Because you are now logged in, you'll see the blue banner with My profile and My programs.\nThese tabs exist for you students too. In My programs you can find all the codes that have been saved.\n\nYou can save your projects easily by giving your project a name in the white bar and pressing the green button Save Code.\n\nLet the programming fun begin!\n"

    -   title: Instruado per Hedy
        text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons:\n"
    -   title: Enkonduko
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"
    -   title: Kvizo
        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\n"
    -   title: Taksado
        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"

        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: "For example they type a sentence without using print.\n"
                error_code: "Hedy can't print this\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.\n"
                solution_code: "presu Hedy povas presi tion!\n"
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                error_text: "Commands won't work if they are in capitals.\n"
                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals.\n"
                solution_text: "Remove the capitals.\n"
                solution_code: "ask Why does my code work now?\nprint Because I removed the capitals!\n"
        -   title: Students use echo without ask
            example:
                error_text: "Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.\n"
                error_code: "eĥu Via nomo estas\n"
                solution_text: "Add an ask command to make it work.\n"
                solution_code: "demandu Kio estas via nomo?\neĥu Via nomo estas\n"
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!\n"
                solution_text: "In level 1 we have to keep it at this:\n"
                solution_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho The best is...\n"
        -   title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
            example:
                error_text: "Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.\n"
                error_code: "antaŭen 300\nturnu 90\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"
                solution_code: "antaŭen 100\nturnu 90\n"
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doens't exist"
            example:
                error_text: "Backward is not a command.\n"
                error_code: "malantaŭen 100\n"
                solution_text: "To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:\n"
                solution_code: "antaŭen -100\n"
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: Students make typos in their commands
            example:
                error_text: "Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.\n"
                error_code: "prinnt Don't make typos!\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.\n"
                solution_code: "print Don't make typos!\n"
        -   title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
            example:
                error_text: "In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.\n"
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_text: "In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.\n"
                solution_code: "order is What would you like to eat?\n"
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command. '
            example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                error_code: "answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!\necho\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                solution_code: "answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!\nprint answer\n"
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_text: "So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students try to print whole lists
            example:
                error_text: "A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.\n"
                error_code: "groceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries\n"
                solution_text: "To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.\n"
                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text.
            example:
                error_text: "This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n\nor\n\nanimal is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animal at random\n"
                solution_text: "Don;t use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n\nor\n\nanimals is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animals at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget at in at random
            example:
                error_text: "Like in the example\n"
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random\n"
                solution_text: "This problem is solved by adding the word at.\n"
                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command.
            example:
                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                error_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nfruit at random\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
                solution_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nprint fruit at random\n"
        -   example:
                solution_code: "picoj estas funga, tinusa, kvarsezona\npresu picoj laŭ hazardo\n"
                error_text: "In a list items are seperated with a comma.\n"
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                solution_text: "After each item on your list, there should be a comma\n"
            title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
        -   title: Students try to use at random without a list.
            example:
                error_text: "Ekzemple,\n"
                error_code: "kluboj estas Manĉestro Unuiĝinta\npresu kluboj laŭ hazardo\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.\n"
                solution_code: "kluboj estas Manĉestro Unuiĝinta, Bavario Munkeno, FK Barcelono\npresu kluboj laŭ hazardo\n"
        -   title: 'Students try to use add/remove without a list '
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below 'names' is not a list, but a variable. You cannot add anything to it.\n"
                error_code: "nomoj estas Jake\nvia_nomo estas demandu Kiu vi estas?\naldonu via_nomo al nomoj\npresu nomoj laŭ hazardo\n"
                solution_text: "There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.\n"
                solution_code: "names is Jake, Amy\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use to/from in add/remove.
            example:
                error_text: "Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.\n"
                error_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice\nremove dice\nprint I love adventures at random\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy has to know which list the item should be added to/removed from.\n"
                solution_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice to adventures\nremove dice from adventures\nprint I love adventures at random\n"
        level: '3'
    -   level: '4'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use quotation marks on both sides of the text
            example:
                error_text: "In this level print and ask need a set of quotation marks. One before of the text and one after.\n"
                error_code: "presu Saluton\nsento estas demandu 'Kiel vi fartas?\n"
                solution_text: "Add the correct quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "presu 'Saluton'\nsento estas demandu 'Kiel vi fartas?'\n"
        -   title: Students use the wrong quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: "It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. ELse they might use the \"double quotes\" or the `skewed one`.\n"
                error_code: "print `Welcome to the restaurant`\nfood is ask \"What would you like to order?\"\n"
                solution_text: "These are the correct quotation marks:\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Welcome to the restaurant'\nfood is ask 'What would you like to order?'\n"
        -   title: Students use an apostrophe in their text
            example:
                error_text: "From this level on apostrophes are not allowed. They are often used in English when thyping contractions like you're, don't or what's.\n"
                error_code: "presu 'Jen eraro pri l' sintakso'\n"
                solution_text: "You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.\n"
                solution_code: "presu 'Tio ne estas eraro pri l sintakso'\npresu 'Tio ne estas eraro pri l` sintakso'\n"
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use print in an if command
            example:
                error_text: "After students use if or else they forget to use a second command like print or ask.\n"
                error_code: "se nomo estas Hedy 'Bonege!'\nalie 'Hedy estus pli bona!'\n"
                solution_text: "Add the print command to fix it.\n"
                solution_code: "se nomo estas Hedy 'Bonege!'\nalie presu 'Hedy estus pli bona!'\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask 'What is your horse called?'\nif name is Bonfire print 'cool'\nelse print 'less cool!'\n"
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "horse is ask 'What is your horse called'\nif horse is Bonfire print 'cool!'\nelse print 'less cool!'\n"
        -   title: Students still forget the quotes on both sides.
            example:
                error_text: "If commandos can get very long and students tend to forget to use quotes.\n"
                error_code: "if name is Hedy print fun\nelse print 'meh!\n"
                solution_text: "Always use 2 quotes in a print command.\n"
                solution_code: "se nomo estas Hedy presu 'amuza'\nalie presu 'ba!'\n"
        -   title: Students use quotes around variable names.
            example:
                error_text: "In this level there are no quotes around variable names.\n"
                error_code: "if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!'\n"
                solution_text: "Remove the quotes to get the code to work.\n"
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!\n"
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask 'Which door do you pick?'\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask 'which door do you pick?'\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "For example this student Hedy to tell all his friends that they are funny, but other classmates would be told that they are not.\n"
                error_code: "if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'You are funny' else print 'You are not funny'\n"
                solution_text: "You could use the `in` command for that. It is explained in a higher level, but it does already work in level 5.\nAnother solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny.\n"
                solution_code: "friends is Jesse, David, Souf\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif name in friends print 'You are funny'\nelse print 'You are not funny'\n\nor\n\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif naam is Jesse print 'You are funny'\nif naam is David print 'You are funny'\nif naam is Souf print 'You are funny'\n"
            title: Students want multiple answers to be correct
        -   example:

    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.\n"

    text: "Lerni programi povas esti malfacila. Ne ke la programado mem *estas* malfacila! Sed estas multaj reguloj, kiujn vi devas enmemorigi, same kiel kiam vi komencis lerni Esperanton.\nSimile, vi bezonos multan praktikon por lerni programadon.\n\nVi povas legi ĉi tiujn frazojn facile. Sed ĉu vi memoras, kiam vi lernis legi? Vi prenis iom da tempo tiam por ĉiu letero!\nTio validas ankaŭ por programado, eble estos malfacile komence, sed ĝi plifaciliĝos!\n\nLa agrabla afero pri Hedy estas ke Hedy estas *laŭgrada*. Tio signifas, ke vi ne devas lerni ĉiujn regulojn samtempe.\nLa unuaj malmultaj niveloj ne havas tiom da reguloj, do vi povas komforte alkutimiĝi al programado.\nEn ĉiu nivelo ni aldonas novajn regulojn, pliigante la nombron da komandoj kiujn vi konas. Komandoj estas instrukcioj por komputilo.\n"
-   title: Kial Hedy estas laŭgrada?
    text: "En la jena anglalingva video, Felienne, la kreinto de Hedy, klarigas kial Hedy estas laŭgrada.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"mx-auto mt-4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdqT313rM40\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"
-   title: Por kiuj estas Hedy?
    text: "Hedy estas por ĉiuj infanoj, kiuj volas lerni programadon! Tamen, ni postulas al vi la kapablon legi Esperanton facile.\n"
-   title: Ĉu mi bezonas sperton pri programado?
    text: "Ne, tio ne estas bezonata. Tamen, se vi programis per Scratch aŭ Python, kelkaj komandoj aspektos konataj al vi.\n"
-   title: Ĉu Hedy estas senkosta?
    text: "Jes! La Universitato de Lejdeno permesas al ni disponigi ĝin senpage. Hedy ankaŭ estas «Malfermita Fonto», kio signifas, ke ĉiuj, kiuj povas programi, rajtas helpi nin plibonigi Hedy.\nVi povas trovi la kodon ĉe [GitHub](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy).\nSe vi ŝatas Hedy kaj volas kontribui, ni ja akceptas [donacojn](https://www.steunleiden.nl/project/hedy) (kaj dankegas pro ajnaj donacoj)!\n"
-   title: Ĉu mi devas instali ion?
    text: Ne. Hedy funkcias en la TTT-legilo, kiu estas la programo, kiun vi uzas por legi ĉi tiun paĝon. Verŝajne Chrome aŭ Edge aŭ Firefox. Hedy ankaŭ funkcias sur via telefono aŭ tabulkomputilo.
