    -   title: "What's Hedy?"
        text: |
            Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).
            In contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn't use code blocks but textual code.
            So with Hedy you'll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises.
            This way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way!
            If you want to know more, you can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s" target="_blank">video</a> about the development of Hedy as a programming language.
    -   title: "Target audience"
        text: |
            Hedy is developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).
            It's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.
            Students (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy.
    -   title: "How does Hedy work?"
        text: |
            Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught. Each level contains a variety of adventures to practice the newly learned commands.
            As a teacher, you get to decide which adventures are available for your students. Will they be making a restaurant, a calculator or a haunted house this level? Within each level, the adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest.
            So your students keep getting challenged. The adventures can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in a classical instruction.

            The adventures also include a code example, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers are able to use Hedy too!
            Of course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and adventures!

            After programming all the adventures of a certain level, your students can test their knowledge in the quiz.
            You can track your students' work and their progress on the class page.
    -   title: "Devices"
        text: |
            Hedy работает через Интернет, что означает, что он работает на любом устройстве с браузером (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge и т.д.), поэтому ноутбуки, Chromebook, планшеты и даже смартфоны подходят для использования Hedy.
            Перед работой с Hedy не нужно ничего скачивать, просто зайдите на сайт, и всё!

    -   title: "Creating a Class"
        text: |
            Как учитель, вы можете создать класс для своих учеников. В этом классе вы можете видеть учетные записи учеников и их программы, а также следить за их успехами.
            В этом видео <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3RTIWftJQg" target="_blank"></a> показано, как быстро создать класс в Hedy.
    -   title: "Customize your Class"
        text: |
            Вы также можете настроить свой класс и выбрать, какие приключения будут доступны для них. Таким образом, ваши ученики не будут перегружены количеством приключений и уровней, и смогут сосредоточиться на тех приключениях, которые вы хотите, чтобы они практиковали.
            В этом <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qva9gXBoUwY&t=10s" target="_blank">видео</a> показано, как настроить свой класс.
    -   title: "Student Accounts"
        text: |
            There are 2 ways to let your students join your class: You can create accounts for them, or they could create their own accounts.

            **You create accounts for your students**
            The easiest way to add students to your class is by creating an account for them. This can be done by clicking the 'create student accounts' button and filling in the usernames and passwords for them.
            The students can login with the username and password that you chose. Afterwards, they can change their username or password if they'd like and they'll still remain in your class.
            This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEQvik-Ce5M) shows how to add students to your class in the quickest and easiest way.

            **Students make their own accounts**
            Your students can also go to the Hedy website and create their own accounts, just like you did. To get them into your class, they simply have to click the invite link.
            You can find the invite link on the class page and send it to your students. Mind that your students have to be logged in to Hedy when they click the link, in order to make it work smoothly.
            You can also manually invite a student to your class with the button 'Invite by username'.

    -   title: "Setting preferred language"
        text: |
            When students create profiles they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.
            Changing this language can always be done later on by navigating to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.
            From December 2021, setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.
            When your account or your students' accounts have been created earlier than this date, you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.
            Don't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.
            Until you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.

            **For non-English speakers**
            Not only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.
            This way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own language. For example, Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.

            **Video**
            This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrVZETj4oLM) show you how to set a preferred language and change the keywords to you preferred language as well.

    -   title: "Storing programs"
        text: |
            When you are logged in, you'll see My programs next to your profile icon.
            This option exists for your students too. In My programs you can find all the programs that you've worked on.
            By default, programs will be saved to 'My programs' when you run the code, and every 10 seconds, under their default name
            and their level (for example: Story 5). If you want to store a program under a new name, just type the new name in the name bar.
            Currently, only one program can be saved per level, per tab.

            You (and your students) can also share programs using the share button next to program names.
            These programs will be posted on our <a href="https://hedy.org/explore" target="_blank">explore page</a>, for everybody to see and use.
            If you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.

            The paper plane icon can be used to hand in programs to the teacher of a class. Programs that have been handed is will no longer be editable.

    -   title: "Обучение с Hedy"
        text: |
            Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.
            This gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.
            We use this structure in our lessons: Introduction, New concepts and commands, let's get to work, puzzels and quizzes.
    -   title: "Слайды"
        text: |
            **COMING SOON** Here you'll soon find slides to use in your lessons.
    -   title: "Введение"
        text: |
            You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?
            This way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you start introducing the new lesson.
    -   title: "Введение новых понятий и команд"
        text: |
            The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.
            That's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.
            Especially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.
            Showing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog'). Our slides could help you with that.
    -   title: "Приступаем к работе"
        text: |
            Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.
            The following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.
            The adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.
            The last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.
            They don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.
            The example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.
            Stimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.

        text: |
            To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.
            The quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.
            Not every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.
            Some levels also contain puzzels. Puzzels show the students a couple of line of code that the students have to put in the right order.

            This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNh5EdZVUwc) shows the quizzes and puzzels.
    -   title: "Оценка"
        text: |
            Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?
            How did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?
            Students are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.

        You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!
        Making mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!
        Especially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.

            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example they type a sentence without using print.
                error_code: |
                    Hedy не может напечатать это
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.

                    напечатать Хеди может напечатать это!
        -   title: "Студенты используют заглавные буквы при наборе команд"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Commands won't work if they are in capitals.
                error_code: |
                    Ask Why does my code fail?
                    Print Because I'm using capitals.
                solution_text: |
                    Уберите заглавные буквы.
                solution_code: |
                    ask Why does my code work now?
                    print Because I removed the capitals!
        -   title: "Студенты используют эхо без вопроса"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.
                error_code: |
                    эхо Ваше имя
                solution_text: |
                    Add an ask command to make it work.
                solution_code: |
                    ask What's your name?
                    echo Your name is
        -   title: "Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.
                error_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo is the best!
                solution_text: |
                    In level 1 we have to keep it at this:
                solution_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo The best is...
        -   title: "Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.
                error_code: |
                    вперед 300
                    поворот 90
                solution_text: |
                    In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.
                solution_code: |
                    вперед 100
                    поворот 90
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doesn't exist"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Назад - это не команда.
                error_code: |
                    назад 100
                solution_text: |
                    To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:
                solution_code: |
                    вперед -100
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: "Студенты допускают опечатки в своих командах"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.
                error_code: |
                    наппечатать Не делайте опечаток!
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.
                solution_code: |
                    напечатать Не делайте опечаток!
        -   title: "Students forget that the ask command has changed"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.
                error_code: |
                    спросить что бы вы хотели съесть?
                solution_text: |
                    In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.
                solution_code: |
                    order is ask What would you like to eat?
        -   title: "Студенты пытаются использовать команду эхо "
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!
                error_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!
                    echo
                solution_text: |
                    Вместо этого используйте переменную.
                solution_code: |

-   title: Текстовое программирование стало проще!
    text: "Многие школы и учителя по всему миру хотят научить своих учеников программированию. Вначале это часто делается с помощью игровых инструментов, начиная от робота Beebot и заканчивая\nScratch Junior или Scratch. После использования таких инструментов дети часто хотят перейти к более мощным текстовым языкам программирования, таким как Python.\n\nОднако Python сложен, потому что он доступен только на английском языке и требует от учеников одновременного изучения сложных концепций программирования и синтаксиса.\nHedy - это простой способ начать изучать текстовые языки программирования! Hedy бесплатен в использовании, имеет открытый исходный код и не похож ни на один другой язык текстового программирования по трем параметрам.\n\n1. Hedy является мультиязычным, вы можете использовать Hedy на своем родном языке.\n2. Hedy является постепенным, поэтому вы можете изучать одну концепцию и ее синтаксис за раз.\n3. Hedy создан для работы в классе, что позволяет учителям полностью адаптировать опыт своих учеников.\n"
-   title: Многоязычное программирование
    text: "В то время как почти все текстовые языки программирования имеют ключевые слова на английском языке, такие как `for` или `repeat`, Hedy можно использовать на любом языке! В настоящее время мы поддерживаем 39 различных языков, включая испанский, арабский, упрощенный китайский и хинди. Если ваш язык недоступен, вы всегда можете начать новый перевод.\n"
-   title: Пошаговое обучение
    text: "Изучение языка программирования может оказаться непосильной задачей, поскольку учащимся приходится одновременно изучать концепции (например, if-else или циклы) и синтаксис (например, кавычки или круглые скобки). В Hedy понятия сначала вводятся с небольшим количеством синтаксиса, а затем совершенствуются. Научно доказанный способ обучения!\n"
-   title: "Создан для классной комнаты"
    text: |
        Hedy предназначен для детей в возрасте от 10 лет и старше и разработан для использования в классе.
        Учителя могут использовать наши бесплатные встроенные планы уроков, а также создавать собственные уроки и загружать их в пользовательский интерфейс Hedy.
-   title: "Программирование в контексте"
    text: |
        Hedy демонстрирует программирование в самом широком смысле и может быть использован различными увлекательными способами. Hedy позволяет создавать цифровые и интерактивные истории, красочные рисунки, которые можно не только показывать на экране, но и рисовать пером или вышивать на рубашке, а также использовать для создания игр или приложений с кнопками и действиями на клавиатуре.
-   title: Понадобится ли мне опыт программирования?
    text: "Да! Hedy имеет \"открытый исходный код\", что означает, что каждый может помочь нам сделать Hedy лучше.\nВы можете найти наш код на <a href=\"https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>.\nЕсли вам нравится Hedy и вы хотите внести свой вклад, мы принимаем (и очень благодарны за это) <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg\" target=\"_blank\">пожертвования</a>!\n"
-   title: Бесплатен ли Хэди?
    text: "Да! Это так благодаря Лейденскому университету в Нидерландах. Более того, Хэди — язык с открытым исходным кодом. Это значит, что любой, кто умеет программировать, может помочь нам в его разработке.\nИсходный код Хэди доступен на [GitHub](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy).\nЕсли вам нравится Хэди и вы готовы помочь, мы будем очень благодарны [пожертвованиям](https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg).\n"
-   title: Нужно ли мне что-то устанавливать?
    text: Нет. Хэди работает в браузере — в той же программе, в которой вы сейчас видите эту страницу. Вероятно, это Chrome, Edge или Firefox. Хэди также работает на телефонах и планшетах.
