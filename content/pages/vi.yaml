    -   text: "Hedy là một ngôn ngữ lập trình dạng văn bản, được phát triển đặc biệt dành cho thiếu niên (10 đến 15 tuổi).\nTrái ngược với các ngôn ngữ lập trình dành cho trẻ em như Scratch, Hedy không sử dụng các khối lệnh mà sử dụng mã văn bản.\nVì vậy, với Hedy, bạn sẽ học cách viết mã như các lập trình viên thực thụ, nhưng theo từng bước nhỏ với các bài tập vui nhộn.\nBằng cách này, Hedy có thể là bước đệm cho các ngôn ngữ lập trình thực sự như Python theo cách dễ tiếp cận và thú vị nhất!\nBạn có thể xem [video tại đây](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmF7HpU_-9k) về sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ lập trình Hedy.\n"
        title: Hedy là gì?
    -   text: "Hedy được phát triển dành cho học sinh trung học cơ sở (10 - 15 tuổi).\nKhả năng đọc hiểu của học sinh rất quan trọng, vì vậy chúng tôi khuyên bạn không nên bắt đầu với Hedy trước khi học sinh đạt được ít nhất trình độ đọc lớp 3.\nHọc sinh (và giáo viên!) không cần bất kỳ kinh nghiệm lập trình nào trước khi bắt đầu với Hedy.\n"

    -   title: Hedy hoạt động như thế nào?
        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught. Each level contains a variety of adventures to practice the newly learned commands.\nAs a teacher, you get to decide which adventures are available for your students. Will they be making a restaurant, a calculator or a haunted house this level? Within each level, the adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest.\nSo your students keep getting challenged. The adventures can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in a classical instruction.\n\nThe adventures also include a code example, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers are able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and adventures!\n\nAfter programming all the adventures of a certain level, your students can test their knowledge in the quiz.\nYou can track your students' work and their progress on the class page.\n"
    -   title: Thiết bị
        text: "Hedy là một ứng dụng web, nghĩa là nó có thể chạy trên mọi thiết bị có trình duyệt web (ví dụ như Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge...). Vì vậy, các loại máy tính, máy tính bảng, hay thậm chí là điện thoại thông minh đều phù hợp để sử dụng Hedy.\nKhông cần tải xuống thứ gì trước để có thể làm việc với Hedy, chỉ cần truy cập website là bạn đã có thể sẵn sàng!\n"
    -   title: Cộng đồng Hedy
        text: "Mọi giáo viên, lập trình viên hay người hâm mộ Hedy đều được chào đón tại [máy chủ Discord của chúng tôi](https://discord.gg/8yY7dEme9r). Đây là nơi lý tưởng để trò chuyện về Hedy: chúng tôi có các kênh để bạn có thể chia sẻ những dự án và bài học thú vị, để có thể báo cáo về lỗi phát sinh, và để nói chuyện cùng với những giáo viên khác và đội ngũ Hedy.\n"

    -   title: Creating a Class
        text: "As a teacher, you can create a class for your students. In this class you can see the students' accounts and their programs and you could monitor their progress.\nYou can also customize your class and choose which adventures are available for them. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.\n"
    -   title: Student Accounts
        text: "There are 2 ways to let your students join your class: You can let them make their own accounts or you can create accounts for them.\n\n**Students make their own accounts**\nYour students can go to the Hedy website and create their own accounts, just like you did. To get them into your class, they simply have to click the invite link.\nYou can find the invite link on the class page and send it to your students. Mind that your students have to be logged in to Hedy when they click the link, so make ot work smoothly.\n\n**You create accounts for your students**\nSometimes it's easier to create a whole bunch of accounts for your students yourself. This can be done by clicking the 'create student accounts' button and filling in usernames and passwords for them.\nThe students can login with the username and password that you chose. Afterwards, they can change their username or password if they'd like and they'll still remain in your class.\n"
    -   title: Setting preferred language
        text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.\nUntil you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.\n\n**For non-English speakers**\nNot only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.\nThis way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own laguage. For example Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.\n"
    -   title: Storing programs
        text: "Because you are now logged in, you'll see the blue banner with My profile and My programs.\nThese tabs exist for your students too. In My programs you can find all the codes that you've saved.\n\nYou can save your projects easily by giving your project a name in the white bar and pressing the green button Save Code.\nYou (and your students) can also share programs. These programs will be posted on our explore page, for everybody to see and use.\nIf you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.\n"

    -   title: Teaching with Hedy
        text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons:\n"
    -   title: Introduction
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"
    -   title: Quiz
        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\n"
    -   title: Evaluation
        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"

        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: "For example they type a sentence without using print.\n"
                error_code: "Hedy can't print this\n"

                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals.\n"
            title: Students use capitals when typing commands
        -   title: Students use echo without ask
            example:
                error_text: "Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.\n"
                error_code: "echo Your name is\n"

                solution_code: "ask What's your name?\necho Your name is\n"
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!\n"
                solution_text: "In level 1 we have to keep it at this:\n"
                solution_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho The best is...\n"

                error_text: "Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.\n"
                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"
                solution_code: "forward 100\nturn 90\n"
            title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'

            example:
                error_text: "Backward is not a command.\n"
                error_code: "backward 100\n"
                solution_text: "To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:\n"

        -   example:
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_text: "In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.\n"
                error_text: "In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.\n"
                solution_code: "order is ask What would you like to eat?\n"
            title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command '
            example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                solution_code: "answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!\nprint answer\n"
                error_code: "answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!\necho\n"
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_text: "So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?\n"

                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?\n"
            title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
        -   example:
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
            title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
        level: '2'
    -   sections:
        -   example:
                solution_text: "To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.\n"
                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"

                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command
            example:
                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                error_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nfruit at random\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
                solution_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nprint fruit at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_text: "In a list items are seperated with a comma.\n"
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"

    title: Frequently made mistakes
    key: common_mistakes
    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.\n"

-   title: What is a gradual programming language?
    text: "Learning to program can be hard. Not that programming itself *is* hard! But there are a lot of rules you need to memorize, just like when you started to learn English.\nSimilarly, you will need a lot of practice to learn programming.\n\nYou can read these sentences with ease. But do you remember when you were learning to read? You took some time then for each letter!\nThat is true for programming too, it might be hard in the beginning, but it will get easier!\n\nThe nice thing about Hedy is that Hedy is *gradual*. That means that you do not have to learn all rules at once.\nThe first few levels do not have that many rules, so you can get used to programming comfortably.\nIn every level we add new rules, increasing the number of commands that you know. Commands are instructions for a computer.\n"
-   title: Why is Hedy gradual?
    text: "Trong video này, Felienne – tác giả của Hedy, giải thích vì sao Hedy có tính chất \"từng bước\".\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"mx-auto mt-4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmF7HpU_-9k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"
-   title: Who is Hedy for?
    text: "Hedy is meant for all kids that want to learn programming! You do need to be able to read English with ease.\n"
-   title: Do I need programming experience?
    text: "No, that is not needed. However, if you have programmed with Scratch or Python, some commands will look familiar to you.\n"
-   title: Is Hedy free?
    text: "Yes! Leiden University allows us to share it for free. Hedy is also 'Open source', which means that everyone who can program can help us make Hedy better.\nYou can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy).\nIf you like Hedy and want to contribute, we do accept (and are very grateful for) [donations](https://www.steunleiden.nl/project/hedy)!\n"
-   title: Do I need to install anything?
    text: No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on your phone or tablet.
