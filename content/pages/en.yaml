    -   title: "What's Hedy?"
        text: |
            Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).
            In contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn't use code blocks but textual code.
            So with Hedy you'll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises.
            This way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way!
            If you want to know more, you can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s" target="_blank">video</a> about the development of Hedy as a programming language.
    -   title: "Target audience"
        text: |
            Hedy is developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).
            It's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.
            Students (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy.
    -   title: "How does Hedy work?"
        text: |
            Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught. Each level contains a variety of adventures to practice the newly learned commands.
            As a teacher, you get to decide which adventures are available for your students. Will they be making a restaurant, a calculator or a haunted house this level? Within each level, the adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest.
            So your students keep getting challenged. The adventures can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in a classical instruction.

            The adventures also include a code example, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers are able to use Hedy too!
            Of course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and adventures!

            After programming all the adventures of a certain level, your students can test their knowledge in the quiz.
            You can track your students' work and their progress on the class page.
    -   title: "Devices"
        text: |
            Hedy is web-based, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, Chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.
            There's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!
    -   title: "The Hedy Community"

    -   title: "Creating a Class"
        text: |
            As a teacher, you can create a class for your students. In this class you can see the students' accounts and their programs and you could monitor their progress.
            This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3RTIWftJQg" target="_blank">video</a> shows you how to quickly create a class in Hedy.
    -   title: "Customize your Class"
        text: |
            You can also customize your class and choose which adventures are available for them. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.
            This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qva9gXBoUwY&t=10s" target="_blank">video</a> shows you how to customize your class.
    -   title: "Student Accounts"
        text: |
            There are 2 ways to let your students join your class: You can create accounts for them, or they could create their own accounts.

            **You create accounts for your students**
            The easiest way to add students to your class is by creating an account for them. This can be done by clicking the 'create student accounts' button and filling in the usernames and passwords for them.
            The students can login with the username and password that you chose. Afterwards, they can change their username or password if they'd like and they'll still remain in your class.
            This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEQvik-Ce5M" target="_blank">video</a> shows how to add students to your class in the quickest and easiest way.

            **Students make their own accounts**
            Your students can also go to the Hedy website and create their own accounts, just like you did. To get them into your class, they simply have to click the invite link.
            You can find the invite link on the class page and send it to your students. Mind that your students have to be logged in to Hedy when they click the link, in order to make it work smoothly.
            You can also manually invite a student to your class with the button 'Invite by username'.

    -   title: "Setting preferred language"
        text: |
            When students create profiles they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.
            Changing this language can always be done later on by navigating to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.
            From December 2021, setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.
            When your account or your students' accounts have been created earlier than this date, you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.
            Don't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.
            Until you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.

            **For non-English speakers**
            Not only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.
            This way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own language. For example, Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.

            **Video**
            This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrVZETj4oLM" target="_blank">video</a> show you how to set a preferred language and change the keywords to you preferred language as well.

    -   title: "Storing programs"
        text: |
            When you are logged in, you'll see My programs next to your profile icon.
            This option exists for your students too. In My programs you can find all the programs that you've worked on.
            By default, programs will be saved to 'My programs' when you run the code, and every 10 seconds, under their default name
            and their level (for example: Story 5). If you want to store a program under a new name, just type the new name in the name bar.
            Currently, only one program can be saved per level, per tab.

            You (and your students) can also share programs using the share button next to program names.
            These programs will be posted on our <a href="https://hedy.org/explore" target="_blank">explore page</a>, for everybody to see and use.
            If you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.

            The paper plane icon can be used to hand in programs to the teacher of a class. Programs that have been handed is will no longer be editable.

    -   title: "Teaching with Hedy"
        text: |
            Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.
            This gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.
            We use this structure in our lessons: Introduction, New concepts and commands, let's get to work, puzzels and quizzes.
    -   title: "Slides"
        text: |
            **COMING SOON** Here you'll soon find slides to use in your lessons.
    -   title: "Introduction"
        text: |
            You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?
            This way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you start introducing the new lesson.
    -   title: "Introduction of new concepts and commands"
        text: |
            The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.
            That's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.
            Especially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience with programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.
            Showing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').
    -   title: "Let's get to work"
        text: |
            Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.
            The following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.
            The adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.
            The last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.
            They don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.
            The example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.
            Stimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.
    -   title: "Quizzes and puzzels"
        text: |
            To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them take the quiz.
            The quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.
            Not every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.
            Some levels also contain puzzles. Puzzles show the students a couple of line of code that the students have to put in the right order.

            This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNh5EdZVUwc" target="_blank">video</a> shows the quizzes and puzzles.
    -   title: "Evaluation"
        text: |
            Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?
            How did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?
            Students are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and give your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.

                    In this single line 2 variables have been used to create a summary of the order.
                    Now add your own summary of the food and drinks ordered by the customer.

                    **Extra** Now that you've learned how to use variables, you can use as many variables in one line as you'd like. Can you add more variables to your code, like eat in or take-away, cash or card, with or without a straw etc.?

-   title: "Common mistakes"
    key: "common_mistakes"
    intro: |
        You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!
        Making mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!
        Especially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.
    levels:
    -   level: '1'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students forget to type commandos"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example they type a sentence without using print.
                error_code: |
                    Hedy can't print this
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.
                solution_code: |
                    print Hedy can print this!
        -   title: "Students use capitals when typing commands"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Commands won't work if they are in capitals.
                error_code: |
                    Ask Why does my code fail?
                    Print Because I'm using capitals.
                solution_text: |
                    Remove the capitals.
                solution_code: |
                    ask Why does my code work now?
                    print Because I removed the capitals!
        -   title: "Students use echo without ask"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.
                error_code: |
                    echo Your name is
                solution_text: |
                    Add an ask command to make it work.
                solution_code: |
                    ask What's your name?
                    echo Your name is
        -   title: "Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.
                error_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo is the best!
                solution_text: |
                    In level 1 we have to keep it at this:
                solution_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo The best is...
        -   title: "Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.
                error_code: |
                    forward 300
                    turn 90
                solution_text: |
                    In the example, students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Even though it does work, you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.
                solution_code: |
                    forward 100
                    turn 90
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doesn't exist"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Backward is not a command.
                error_code: |
                    backward 100
                solution_text: |
                    To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:
                solution_code: |
                    forward -100
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students make typos in their commands"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.
                error_code: |
                    prinnt Don't make typos!
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.
                solution_code: |
                    print Don't make typos!
        -   title: "Students forget that the ask command has changed"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.
                error_code: |
                    ask what would you like to eat?
                solution_text: |
                    In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.
                solution_code: |
                    order is ask What would you like to eat?
        -   title: "Students try to use the echo command "
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!
                error_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!
                    echo
                solution_text: |
                    Use a varible instead.
                solution_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!
                    print answer
        -   title: "Students use a variable name or as a normal word"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In the example below the word 'name' is used as a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.
                error_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi my name is name
                solution_text: |
                    So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi I'm name
        -   title: "Students use long variable names containing two words."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: |
                    chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?
                solution_text: |
                    Add an underscore.
                solution_code: |
                    chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?
        -   title: "Students might use two different names for the same variable"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: |
                    horse is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name
                solution_text: |
                    Always check whether the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: |
                    name is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name
    -   level: '3'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students try to print whole lists"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with {at} {random}.
                error_code: |
                    groceries is apples, milk, chocolate
                    print groceries
                solution_text: |
                    To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a `{print}` command. Else you can use the list to print one item with `{at}` `{random}`.
                solution_code: |
                    {print} apples, milk, chocolate

                    or

                    groceries {is} apples, milk, chocolate
                    {print} groceries {at} {random}

                    Another solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny.

                    Indentation is a new concept in this level, that is hard to use for some students. Make sure they practise some simple codes before making a whole program with it.

                error_text: |
                    For instance, in the code below the student wanted to take the drinks order of 3 people. But instead the program asked 3 times, but only wrote down one order.
                error_code: |
                    repeat 3 times

                solution_text: |
                    In the correct code the third line starts with indentation too. This way it belongs to the repeat block and therefore it will be repeated 3 times.
                    Showing your students these differences can help them understand why we need indentation to make our programs work.

                    In line 2 the computer is asked to check whether the variable password is the same as the variable password, so itself. Which means the answer is always yes.
                    So with this code the answer will always be 'You can come in' no matter what the player fills in.
                error_code: |

                solution_text: |
                    You can fix this mistake by adding quotation marks. This way the computer knows that the second password in `{if} password {is} 'password'` is a string value (so normal text) and not the variable name.

-   title: "Textual programming made easy!"
    text: |
        Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to
        Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.

        Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.
        Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.

        1. Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language
        2. Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time
        3. Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience
-   title: "Multi-lingual programming"
    text: |
        While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as `for` or `repeat`, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 39 different languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a new translation.
-   title: "Step by step learning"
    text: |
        Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!
-   title: "Built for the classroom"
    text: |
        Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
        Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.
-   title: "Programming in context"
    text: |
        Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.
-   title: "Is Hedy free?"
    text: |
        Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.
        You can find our code on <a href="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy" target="_blank">Github</a>.
        If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg" target="_blank">donations</a>!

-   title: "Do I need to install anything?"
    text: |-
        No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.
-   title: "Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?"
    text: |-
        No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.
        If you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach
        and frequently made mistakes.

    text: |
        Hedy is designed to support teachers in providing programming lessons in class. We have specific teacher features like the option to create a class, customize it and see how your students are doing.
        If you like Hedy, you can reach out to schools that you know to help teachers get started! We can help you find schools or teachers via <a href="https://discord.gg/8yY7dEme9r" target="_blank">Discord</a>.
