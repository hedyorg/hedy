                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    jmeno {is} {ask} Jak se jmenuje hlavn칤 postava?
                    {print} jmeno te캞 bude b캩hat v lese

                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.

                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can use randomness for any monster, animal or other obstacle, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} 游붒, 游, 游불, 游붆
                    {print} They now hear the sound of an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story. For example
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Sly코칤 zvuk
                    zv칤콏ata {is} 游, 游붒, 游붆, 游불
                    zvire {is} {ask} Co si mysl칤코, 쬰 to je?
                    {add} zvire {to_list} zv칤콏ata
                    {print} to byla zv칤콏ata {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code and finish it by adding quotation marks on the blanks in lines 1 and 2.
                    The blanks in line 3 and 4 should not be replaced by quotation marks, but a `{sleep}` and a `{clear}` command. Can you make it work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your story code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                    Mind: The variables in your own story should be outside of the quotation marks. Just like the second line of the example code. In that line the variable name is placed outside of the quotation marks.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} _ What is your name? _
                    {print}  _ The main character is called _ name
                    _
                    _
                    {print} name  _ is now going to walk in the woods _
                    {print} name _ is a bit scared _
                    animals {is} 游붒, 游, 游불, 游붆
                    {print} _ He hears the sound of a _ animals {at} {random}
                    {print} name _ is afraid this is a haunted forest _
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} '游눤ZAP!游눤'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!游붔'
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'I see a ' animal ' looking at me'
                        {print} animal
                        {print} animal
                        {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {print} 'I see all the animals looking at me!'
                    ```
            12:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    {print} name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly...'
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sword = 'lost'
                    game = 'on'
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 0 {to} 2
                        {if} game {is} 'on'
                            path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'Our hero comes across a dragon!'
                                {print} 'Luckily our hero has a sword to defeat the beast!'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a dragon, but she doesnt have any weapons!'
                                {print} 'Our hero is beaten by the dragon...'
                                {print} 'Try again'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'You have already found the sword. There is nothing left here.'
                                {print} 'She walks back'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a sword'
                                {print} 'This could come in very handy'
                                sword = 'found'
                    ```
            15:
                story_text: |
                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continue the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise
                    The example code shows you how to use the `{while}` loop in a story. Now **think of your own scenario** in which the player has to find something before they can continue.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    {print} 'You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.'
                    {print} 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    {print} 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'
                    {while} keys == 'lost'
                        location = {ask} 'Where do you want to look?'
                        {if} location == 'flowerbed'
                            {print} 'Here they are!'
                            keys = 'found'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Nope they are not at the ' location
                    {print} 'Now you can enter the house!'

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    naam = {input}("What's your name?")
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')
                    ```

                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    like {is} {ask} What is your favorite animal?
                    {add} like {to_list} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ## Remove from
                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    dislike {is} {ask} What animal do you not like?
                    {remove} dislike {from} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}
                    ```

                    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two `{if}`s but can use `{and}` and `{or}`.

                    If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

                    Now that you can use the `{print}` command, you are ready to learn the next command: `{ask}`. With the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question. Check it out:
                example_code: |

                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.
                    Check it out:

                    In the previous tab you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous tab and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.

                    ***Set the variables***
                    Start by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.

                    ***Create a function to calculate the points***
                    Create a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.
                    All the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.
                    Return the variable `points` at the end of the function.

                    ***Test the function***
                    Test if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.
                    Run the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results? Great! Then you can remove the testing part and move on the the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'BLACKJACK'

                    # Set these variables
                    cards = _
                    face_cards = _
                    card_1 =

                    # Create a function to calculate the points
                    {define} calculate_points {with} card:
                        {if} card {in} face_cards:
                            points = _
                        {elif} _
                            _
                        {else}:
                            _
                        _ points

                    # Test your function
                    {print} 'Your card is a ' _
                    {print} 'That is worth ' _ ' points'.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the second part of our Blackjack game.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure***
                    In the previous adventure you've started a list of variables and created a function to calculate how many points a card is worth. Copy your code and paste it here. Mind that you don't need the testing part, so if you haven't removed that yet, please do so now.

                    ***Add more variables***
                    You have already set the lists `cards` and `face_cards` and the variable `card_1`. Underneath those variables create 3 more variables: `card_2`, dealer_card_1` and `dealer_card_2`. These variables are all set to a random card from the list of cards.

                    ***Add up points***
                    To calculate how many points you have scored we call the function with card 1 and we do it again for card 2. Then we add both these scores together to get your total.
                    Do the same thing for the dealers points, but be sure to use the dealer's cards and not your own!

                    ***2 Aces***
                    You're doing great! Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.

                    ***Show the score***
                    Lastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is. Then show which cards the dealer has and how many points they have.

                    ***Continue in the next tab***
                    Great! You have finished this part of the game! Copy your code and go to the next tab to learn how to ask for an extra card and to declare a winner.
                example_code: |

                    card_2 = _
                    dealer_card_1 = _
                    dealer_card_2 = _

                    # Add up your points
                    your_points_1 = {call} _ {with} card_1
                    your_points_2 = _
                    your_total = _

                    # Add up the dealers points
                    dealer_points_1 = _
                    _
                    _

                    # 2 Aces
                    {if} card_1 == 'Ace' {and} _
                        your_total = 12
                    {if} dealer_card_1 _
                        dealer_total = _

                    # Show the score
                    {print} 'You have drawn a ' _ ' and a ' _ '. That is ' _ ' points'
                    {print} 'The dealer has drawn a ' _ ' and a ' _ '. That is ' _ ' points'

                    In the previous tabs you have learned how to draw 2 random cards for yourself and for the dealer and to calculate how many points you both got.
                    In this adventure we add the option to ask for an extra card for both you and the dealer.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Firstly, copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Extra card for you*** If you want, you can get an extra card to get your total as close to 21 as possible. First ask the player if they want an extra card.
                    If they do, pick a random card and print what they have drawn. If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.
                    In case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.
                    If your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.
                    If the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.
                    Lastly, print your new total of points.

                    ***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.
                    Copy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section. Then change it to fit the dealer picking an extra card and getting points added to their total.
                example_code: |

                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    In the last 3 adventures you have alsmost created a working blackjack game! The only thing left to do is to decide a winner!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Start by pasting the code that you've made so far into your programming field.

                    ***Decide a winner***
                    Firstly, if you and the dealer have an equal amount of points, it's a draw.
                    Secondly, if the dealer has more than 21 points and you don't, you are the winner.
                    Thirdly, if both you and the dealer have less than 22 points, we have to see who came closest to 21. We do that by comparing who has the highest score. Is your total higher than the dealer's total, then you are the winner. If not, the dealer wins.
                    Lastly, in all other scenarios (e.g. you have more than 21 points and the dealer doesn't, or you both have more than 21 points) you are the loser.

                    ***Enjoy the game!***
                    Does your game work properly? Amazing! You have done a great job! Enjoy your game!
                    If it doesn't work right away, no worries, you might have made a mistake. Just keep calm and bebug your code using the ladybug button.

                    How much is 1 times 1?
                    How much is 1 times 2?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next tab!**

                    You can add the `{while}` loop to the calculator game you've learned to make in a previous level.
                    This makes sure the player can't continue to the next question if they answer incorrectly.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the `{while}` loop in the function, ask the player what number_1 times number_2 is and print their answer.
                    Then `{call}` the function.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous tab.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.
                    Fix this program to turn it into the nursery rhyme 'Brother John (Fr칟re Jaques)' by using the {repeat} command of course!

                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender

                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    Congratulations! You've reached level 2. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes!
                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time.
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    So let's go to the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    **Warning! This code does not work!**
                    In Hedy commands will change sometimes. `{echo}` for example only works in level 1. In this level you'll learn a better way to echo answers back.
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want

                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    The dice in the example above are dice for a specific game. Can you make normal dice?
                    Or other special dice from a different game?
                example_code_2: |

            5:
                story_text: |
                    You can also make a die again in this level using the `{if}`.
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something {else}.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices {is} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw {is} _
                    {print} 'you have' _ 'thrown'
                    {if} _ {is} earthworm {print} 'You can stop throwing.' _ {print} 'You have to hear it again!'
                    ```
            6:
                story_text: |
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in this, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm points = points + 5 {else} points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code_2: |
                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                    But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm

                    ### Exercise
                    In this level you can create a little game in which you'll have to throw 6 as fast as possible.
                    We have started the code, it's up to you to get the game to work!

                    Firstly, add a `{while}` loop that checks if 6 has been thrown or not.
                    As long as you haven't thrown 6 already, throw the dice on a random number.
                    Print what the player has thrown.
                    Add a try to the amount of tries
                    Wait a second before you throw again, or - in case you've thrown a 6 - before the game ends.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    options = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

                    ## For
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                    ```
                    {for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 10

                    ```
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 10:

                story_text: |
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I뗤 Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ### Exercises
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}
                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                    football = {ask} 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = {ask} 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    {print} 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the `{repeat}` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'You can {ask} 3 questions!'
                    {repeat} 3 {times} question = {ask} 'What do you want to know?'
                    answer = yes, no, maybe
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'My crystal ball says... ' answer {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller {ask} 3 questions and also print them!
                example_code: |

                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {print} 'Lets play a game of Twister!'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 to _
                        {call} turn
                        {sleep} 2
                    ```

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} song {with} place
                        {print} 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    {call} song {with} 'sea'
                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    ```

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _
                    {print} 'The new price is ' new_price ' dollar'
                    ```

                    Let's make functions the Pythons way! To define a function, we no longer use:

                    `{define} name_function {with} argument_1, argument_2:`

                    but we use:

                    `{def} name_function(argument_1, argument_2):`.


                    If you don't want to use arguments, you just leave the space between the parantheses empty.
                    To call a function, we don't need the `{call}` command anymore. You just type the name of the function.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {def} calculate_score(answer, correct_answer):

                    In this adventure we program a game of hangman. First we make some preparations, then we program the game and in the third part we add a drawing with the turtle.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Set the variables*** In this game of hangman, Player 1 chooses an answer and Player 2 has to guess the letters in this answer.
                    To let the computer know all the letters in the word, we will turn the answer into a list of letters. We also do this with the guesses Player 2 makes.
                    We will start the game with 2 empty lists. We have made an empty list for the variable answer for you. Now make an empty list for guessed_letters as well.
                    Then we fill in how many mistakes were made. At the start of the game, this should be 0.
                    The variable `amount_letters` tells us how many letters are in the answer. Ask Player 1 to tell us how many letters their word has.
                    Lastly we tell the computer if the game is over. We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.

                    ***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.
                    Then we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.

                    ***Player 2's turn***
                    Tell Player 2 its their turn. Then tell Player 2 how many letters there are in the answer. Finally, print the list of `guessed_letters`.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Now that all the starting variables are set, we can start programming the game itself. Check out the next tab to learn how!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'Hangman!'

                    # Set the variables
                    answer = []
                    guessed_letters = _
                    mistakes_made = _
                    amount_letters = {ask} _
                    _ = 'False'

                    # Choosing the answer
                    {for} _
                        letter = {ask} 'Player 1, what is letter ' i '?'
                        _
                        {add} '_' {to} _

                    # Player 2 turn
                    print _
                    print _
                    print guessed_letters

                    Now it's time to program the hangman game.

                    ### Exercise

                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste the code in the programming field.

                    ***The game*** This games continues playing until Player 2 is game over. Fill in the while command accordingly. Now, Player 2 is allowed to guess a letter, so ask Player 2 to guess a letter.
                    We need to check if their answer is correct, so check if their `guess` is (somewhere) in the (list) `answer`. Then we let the computer figure out which of the letter(s) is the guess. We have already programmed that part for you.
                    Next we want to compliment the player for finding a correct letter and we want to print the list `guessed_letters`, so the player can see their progress.

                    The next part we're going to program is what happens when the player has guessed all of the letters. So if their list of `guessed_letters` is the same as our list `answer`.
                    If the lists are the same, congratulate Player 2 with their victory and set the variable `game_over` to `True`.

                    Next we'll program what happens when Player 2 guesses wrong (so the `{else}` command). First, tell the player that their guess was wrong. Then increase the `mistakes_made` variable by 1.

                    For the last part we'll program what happens when Player 2 has made 10 mistakes. We'll print that Player 1 has won the game. Then we'll print the correct answer. And finally, we'll set our `game_over` variable to `True`, so the game stops.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Amazing work! Your game is playable, but wouldn't it be fun if the hangman was actually drawn when Player 2 makes a mistake..?

                                if answer[i] == guess:
                                    guessed_letters[i] = guess
                            {print} _

                    In a game of hangman the mistakes are shown by drawing a part of the hangman each time a mistake has been made.
                    We now add those drawings with our turtle!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Create a function that draws the hangman*** Create a function that draws the hangman in 10 steps. We have already made step 1 for you.

                    ***Test the function*** Test the function by calling the function with 10. If you are happy with the function, remove the line that calls the function for now. We will call the function when the player makes a mistake.

                    ***Paste your hangman game under your function*** Go back to the previous tab and copy your hangman game. Paste the game underneath your function.

                    ***Call the function when the player makes a mistake*** Under the line `mistakes_made = mistakes_made + 1` we will call the function. We want the turtle to take the same amount of steps as the player has made mistakes, so we call the function with `mistakes_made` as argument.

                    ***Enjoy your game!***

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but {if} not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and {ask} the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} How did I get here?
                    {print} I remember my friend telling me to go into the old mansion...
                    {print} and suddenly everything went black.
                    {print} But how did I end up on the floor...?
                    {print} My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
                    {print} What's that sound?
                    {print} Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
                    {print} I need to get out of here!
                    {print} There are 3 doors in front of me..
                    {ask} Which door should i pick?
                    {echo} I choose door
                    {print} ...?
                    ```

                    In this haunted house you can choose your monsters with emojis. Of course you could also use words.

                    ```
                    monster1 {is} 游놑
                    monster2 {is} 游뱌
                    monster3 {is} 游놌
                    {print} You enter the haunted house.
                    {print} Suddenly you see a monster1
                    {print} You run into the other room, but a monster2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.
                    {print} But as you enter monster3 attacks you!
                    ```
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    monster_1 {is} 游놑
                    monster_2 {is} 游뱌
                    monster_3 {is} 游놌
                    {print} You enter the haunted house.
                    {print} Suddenly you see a monster_1
                    {print} You run into the other room, but a monster_2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.
                    {print} But as you enter monster_3 attacks you!

                    ### Exercise
                    In the example above the monsters are predetermined. So each time you run your code, the output is the same.
                    Can you add `{ask}` commands to make the haunted house interactive and have the players choose the monsters they come across?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    monster_1 {is} _
                    monster_2 {is} _
                    monster_3 {is} _
                    {print} You enter the haunted house.
                    {print} Suddenly you see a monster_1
                    {print} You run into the other room, but a monster_2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.
                    {print} But as you enter monster_3 attacks you!

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Escape from the haunted house!
                    _ There are 3 doors in front of you...
                    _ _ _ Which door do you choose?
                    _ You picked door ... choice
                    monsters _ a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    _ You see...
                    {sleep}
                    _ _ _ _

                    In this level you learn how to use quotation marks in your games.
                    Can you make your Haunted House level 4 proof?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} _Escape from the haunted house!_
                    {print} _There are 3 doors in front of you..._
                    choice {is} {ask} _Which door do you choose?_
                    {print} _You picked door ..._ choice
                    monsters {is} a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    {print} _You see..._
                    {sleep}
                    {print} monsters {at} {random}
                     ```

                story_text: |
                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Escape from the haunted house!'
                    {print} 'There are 3 doors in front of you...'
                    doors {is} 1, 2, 3
                    monsters {is} werewolf, mummy, vampire, zombie
                    chosen_door {is} {ask} 'Which door do you choose?'
                    {print} 'You chose door...' chosen_door
                    {sleep}
                    correct_door {is} doors {at} {random}
                    {if} chosen_door {is} correct_door {print} 'Great! Youve escaped!'
                    {else} {print} 'Oh no! You are being eaten by a...' monsters {at} {random}
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting, which allows you to make the haunted house even more interactive!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Escape from the Haunted House!'
                    player = alive
                    doors = 1, 2, 3
                    monsters = zombie, vampire, giant spider
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        {if} player {is} alive
                            correct_door {is} doors {at} {random}
                            {print} 'There are 3 doors in front of you...'
                            chosen_door = {ask} 'Which door do you choose?'
                            {if} chosen_door {is} correct_door
                                {print} 'No monsters here!'
                            {else}
                                {print} 'You are eaten by a ' monsters {at} {random}
                                player = dead
                        {else}
                            {print} 'GAME OVER'
                    {if} player {is} alive
                        {print} 'Great! You survived!'
                    ```
                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door en 2 wrong ones?

                    In this level we've changed the repeat command and we've added a line to our haunted house that tells the player in which room they are.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this level you can use the `<` and `>` symbol to introduce lives to your game.
                    Make sure the player loses a life when they come across the wrong monster and that the game stops if you have no lives left.

                    This haunted house game uses the connection between the lists you can use in this level.
                    For example: all the properties that belong to the zombie are first in all the lists, witch second and vampire third.
                    Check out the code and fill in  `weapons[i]`, `monsters[i]` , `bad_fate[i]`, `good_fate[i]`, `hint[i]` on the correct blanks to get the code to work!

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple agruments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with {ask} commands.

                        {else}
                            {print} 'Sorry to hear that.'
                            {print} 'Hopefully you can take a nice rest in you room.'
                        {print} 'Your room number is ' room_number

                    {print} 'Hello. Please fill in your information to check in.'

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'

                    Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    ## If... Else...
                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an {else} command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old

                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animal`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we haved used the variable in a print command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} _
                    {print} I like favorite_animal

                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
            14:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```

                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'You are older than me!'

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    Type a number between 1 and 10 behind the letter to choose the scale, for example after B4 comes C5.
                    C1 is the lowest note you can play, C10 is the highest.

                    You don't always have to use the `{play}` command to play a whole song, sometimes you just want to play one note.
                    For example, if you want to make a quiz, you can play a happy high note if the answer is right and a sad low note if the answer is wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the first question by adding a line of code that plays a C3 note if the wrong answer is given.

                    In this level there is another new keyword: `{pressed}`!
                    With `{pressed}` you can use keys on your keyboard to control what lines are used.

                    ### Exercise
                    Look at the example and add one more line of code that reacts to a key press.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Do you want a good (g) or bad (b) ending?'

                    You can also link turtle commands to keys.

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the lines a few times so you can create a larger drawing.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {if} y {is} {pressed} {forward} 15

                    Now that you have learned about `{repeat}`, we can press keys multiple times.
                    You can use it to make the turtle walk forward and turn.

                    ### Exercise
                    The code you have seen in level 5 only checks the key once. Copy the example code and add a `{repeat}` to it, so that you can press the keys many times.
                    Use this code to draw something nice.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {if} x {is} {pressed} {forward} 15 {else} {turn} 90
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Now that you know how to combine statements, you can create a touch type tool with `{pressed}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.
                    **(extra)** Clear the screen after each letter, and show the user how many points they have scored.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    points = 0

                    In this exercise you will see a pink blank space. You have to fill something in the place of the blank space before the code can be run.

                    Fill in the `{print}` command in the blank space and then add five more lines of code. Each line has to start with a `{print}` command.
                    Have fun!

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'
                    {print} 'We need to use ' answer
                    ```

                    ## Contractions
                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.
                    Check out the example code to see the wrong way of using apostrophes.

                    ```
                    _ This is the wrong way of using apostrophes _
                    {print} 'I'm babysitting my sister's kids'
                    {print} 'What's more fun than that?'
                    ```

                    name = 'Hedy the Robot'

                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Black Widow'.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    superheroes = 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Black Widow'

                    ## At random
                    In this level you can make a list using the `{is}` command. You can let the computer choose a random item from that list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code. The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']
                    {print} friends[1] ' is the first friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[2] ' is the second friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[3] ' is the third friend on the list.'
                    #now we will match 2 lists using the variable i
                    lucky_numbers = [15, 18, 6]
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 3
                        {print} friends[i] 's lucky number is ' lucky_numbers[i]

                    Now that you've learned to use the brackets in lists, you can also start using the {at} {random} command in the Python way!

                    Level 7 adds the `{repeat}` command.  `{repeat}` can be used to execute one line of code multiple times. Like this:

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ``` Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'
                    _ {repeat} 2 {times}
                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your restaurant code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots and add some `{clear}` commands.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Add the quotation marks to this code _
                    {print} Welcome to Restaurant Chez Hedy!
                    {print} Today we are serving pizza or lasagna.
                    food {is} {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {print} Great choice! The  food  is my favorite!
                    topping {is} {ask} Would you like meat or veggies on that?
                    {print} food  with  topping  is on its way!
                    drinks {is} {ask} What would you like to drink with that?
                    {print} Thank you for your order.
                    {print} Your  food  and  drinks  will be right there!
                    ```

                    In this level the {if} command allows you to {ask} your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
                    In the example below, you see that you can {ask} the customer {if} they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    special {is} {ask} 'Would you like to hear our specials today?'
                    {if} special {is} yes {print} 'Todays special is chicken piri piri and rice.' {else} {print} 'No problem.'
                    food {is} {ask} 'What would you like to eat?'
                    {print} 'One ' food ', coming right up!'
                    drink {is} {ask} 'What would you like to drink with that?'
                    {if} drink {is} cola {print} 'Im sorry, we are out of cola!' {else} {print} 'Great choice!'
                    anything {is} {ask} 'Would you like anything {else}?'
                    {print} 'Let me repeat your order...'
                    {print} 'One ' food
                    {if} drink {is} cola {print} 'and...' {else} {print} 'One ' drink
                    {if} anything {is} no {print} 'Thats it!' {else} {print} 'One ' anything
                    {print} 'Thank you for your order and enjoy your meal!'
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you think of more questions to {ask} the customers when they are ordering, and make up different responses to their answers by using the {if} command?

                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10

                    In this level you've learned how to use the {repeat} command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to {ask} multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:

                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    people = {ask} 'How many people are joining us today?'

                    In this level we can determine who won.
                    For that you need the new `{if}` code.

                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                    Then you can use `{if}` to see {if} they are the same or different.

                    Let's make a game of Simon Says! Simon Says is a memory game in which the player will be given a color. They have to repeat that color back.
                    If they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.

                    ***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
                    Then make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.
                    At the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.

                    ***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.
                    We do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.
                    Then create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.

                    ***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).
                    So we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.

                    ***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.
                    Remove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next tab to learn more about the simon says game!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ***Create a function that creates the player_sequence*** The list `player_sequence` is used to capture the answers of the player. First we define the function with the argument level.
                    Next, we ask level times what the color is that they choose. We call that variable `answer`. Then we add the variable `answer` to the list player_sequence.

                    ***Setting up the game*** Before we program the game in the next tab, we'll need some starting variables. First, we'll set the variable `level` to 1 and the variable `game_over` to False.
                    Then we make an introduction for the game. We'll print 'Welcome to Simon Says!' and clear the screen after 1 second.

                    ***Continue to the next tab to finish the game!**** Don't forget to copy your code and take it with you to the next tab.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Program the game*** We start by making sure the game goes on while the game isn't over. Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.
                    Now, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself. To create the list we use the same trick as we did in the previous tab.
                    We'll make a list with the words 'empty' and 'list' on it, and then we remove both these words. Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.
                    Lastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).
                    If that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.
                    Did the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'

                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    This children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.
                    If you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the the code, you can sing the whole song!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    number = 6

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    In this adventure you can program a game of Tic Tac Toe. You can play with two people. Taking turns, you pick a number of the spot (1 - 9) you want to put your sign (x or o) on.
                    The first player that gets 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins!
                    Have fun!

                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                    Fill in the correct numbers in this code to get it to work.
                    After you've done that, you can try to add the option backwards.

                    **Extra** Instead of using 'left' and 'right', remake the program with North, East, South and West.
                    This way you could add even more directions like Northeast and Southwest etc.

                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **(extra)** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.

                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?

                    We can use functions to draw more complex figures with less code.

                    Fill the function so that three squares are created. If you want the image to look nicer, you can make the lines between the squares white.

                    The code can be made even shorter. Place the final lines into a `{repeat}` so the figure remains the same.

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Create your own drawing with different figures.
                    Change both the number of figures with the `{repeat}` and the shape of the figures in the `{define}`

                    ### Exercise
                    Create a program that asks the player how many corners their figure should have and then creates that figure.
                    The figure in the image is the output when the player fills in 10.

                    Star
                    A star is usually drawn using 144-degree-turns. If you change this slightly to 143 degrees for example and repeat the pattern multiple times with a {while} loop you can make this figure.

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!

                    In this level you can use the `{for} i {in} {range}` command to countdown to the New Year.

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work!
