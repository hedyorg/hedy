                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story in Hedy now by using `{print}` , `{ask}` and `{echo}`?
            2:
                story_text: |
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make a story using a variable yourself? Can you add even more variables?
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.
            3:
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you use the 3 new commands `{at} {random}` , `{add} {to_list}` and `{remove} {from}` in your own story?
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    ### Exercise
                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story with repitition?
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story with two different endings?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} '💥ZAP!💥'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!🦖'
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put `{if}`, `{repeat}` or `{for}` commands inside other `{if}`, `{repeat}` or `{for}` commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'I see a ' animal ' looking at me'
                        {print} animal
                        {print} animal
                        {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {print} 'I see all the animals looking at me!'
                    ```
            12:
                story_text: In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    {print} name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly...'
                    ```
            13:
                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own adventure minigame like this?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sword = 'lost'
                    game = 'on'
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 0 {to} 2
                        {if} game {is} 'on'
                            path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'Our hero comes across a dragon!'
                                {print} 'Luckily our hero has a sword to defeat the beast!'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a dragon, but she doesnt have any weapons!'
                                {print} 'Our hero is beaten by the dragon...'
                                {print} 'Try again'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'You have already found the sword. There is nothing left here.'
                                {print} 'She walks back'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a sword'
                                {print} 'This could come in very handy'
                                sword = 'found'
                    ```

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.
                story_text_3: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Try out the new commands in this virtual restaurant. Add the flavor the player is hpoing for to the list and remove the flavors they are allergic to.

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.

                story_text_3: |
                    You can also let the computer do random calculations on its own using {random}.

                    In a previous level you've created a calculator, in this level you can expand that code so it asks multiple questions.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you finish line 10 to get the code to work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Give the player feedback when the enter an answer, like `{print} 'Correct!'` or `{print} 'Wrong! The correct answer is ' correct_answer`.
            11:

                    In this level, you can make a calculator that works for decimal numbers.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill out the blanks to complete the calculator. Remember to use a period and not a comma for decimal numbers.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Create a new mathematics practice program, but now use decimal numbers.
                    Create a list of numbers, choose two to multiple and let the player answer.
                    And of course you have to validate the answer! **(extra)** Increase the difficulty by adding lives: A player loses a life for a wrong answer and after three wrong answers the game ends.

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.

                    ### Exercise
                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender
                    Here are all the days of November
                    November 1
                    November 2
                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    In level 3 you can make a list. You can let the computer choose something random from the list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.

                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.

                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.

                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                    By using `{if}` and `{else}` you can make sure that you will always get a good fotune, while other people might not.
                    Check out this example to find out how.

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
            14:

                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _

                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In this level you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!
                    Do you know which line of code to add on the blanks?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    _ _ _
                        {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                        {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                        {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                        verse = verse - 1
                        {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    In this level you can easily make the childrens' song 'Five little monkeys'. Can you make the last chorus?
                    You can also make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines, using `{for}`!
                    Or you can make Old MacDonald with all the different animals.



                    ### Exercises
                    Can you add the last verse of the monkeys on the bed, when there is only one monkey left?

                    Can you make the baby shark code even shorter by using a `{repeat}` command?

                    Can you add new animals to Old MacDonald's farm?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    monkeys = 5, 4, 3, 2
                    {for} monkey {in} monkeys
                        {print} monkey ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'
                        {print} 'One fell off and bumped his head'
                        {print} 'Mama called the doctor and the doctor said'
                        {print} 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'
                    ```

                    ```
                    sharks = baby, mommy, daddy, grandma, grandpa

                        {print} shark ' shark tututututudu'
                        {print} shark ' shark tututututudu'
                        {print} shark ' shark tututututudu'
                        {print} shark ' shark'
                    ```
                    ```
                    animals = pig, dog, cow

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Print the song Five little moneys jumping on the bed. Look up the text if you don't remember.

                    **(extra)** Print the song Old MacDonald had a farm, and make sure all animals make a different sound, using an `{if}`.

                    In this level you can use the `{for} i {in} {range}` command to make songs that use counting, like the 5 little monkeys.

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work!
                example_code: |

                            {print} 'PUT THOSE MONKEYS RIGHT TO BED!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'

                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Drawing figures
                    angle {is} 90
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    ```
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use use `{at} {random}` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list.
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path?
            5:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    direction {is} {ask} 'Do you want to go left, right, or straight ahead?'
                    if direction is left turn _
                    if direction is right turn _
                    forward 100
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angle = 90
                    {repeat} 10 {times}
                        {turn} angle
                        {forward} 50
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, we can now improve the program that draws different figures.
                    Can you figure out how far the turtle has to turn here? Finish the code and you can draw any polygon you'd like!
            9:
                story_text: |
                    Now that we can use a `{repeat}` inside a `{repeat}`, we can create more complex figures.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **(extra)** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?
