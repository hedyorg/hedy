            1:
                story_text: |
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    In the first line, use `{ask}` and ask who the main character of the story will be.

                    After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} The main character of this story is
                    {print} The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    {echo} He's a bit scared,
                    {print} He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    {print} He's afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story in Hedy now by using `{print}` , `{ask}` and `{echo}`?
                start_code: '{print} Your story starts here'
            2:
                story_text: |
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make a story using a variable yourself? Can you add even more variables?
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} What is the name of the main character?
                    {print} name is now going to run in the woods
                    {print} name is a bit scared
                    {print} Suddenly he hears a crazy noise...
                    {sleep}
                    {print} name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.
                start_code: '{print} Your story'
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can use randomness for any monster, animal or other obstacle, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} He now hears the sound of an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} He hears a sound
                    animals {is} 🐿, 🦔, 🦇, 🦉
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was a animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you use the 3 new commands `{at} {random}` , `{add} {to}` and `{remove} {from}` in your own story?
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} Your story'
            4:
                story_text: |
                    You may have noticed that there is still a problem in the previous levels. Did you try to print a sentence that contained the word name? i.e. `{print}` my name is name.
                    You can solve that in this level. You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hans
                    {print}  _ The name of the main character is _ name
                    {print} name  _ is now going to walk in the woods _
                    {print} name _ is a bit scared _
                    animals {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} _ He hears the sound of a _ animals {at} {random}
                    {print} name _ is afraid this is a haunted forest _
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Your story will be printed here!'''
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    ### Exercise
                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Here your story will start!'''
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story with repitition?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```
                start_code: '{repeat} 5 {times} {print} ''Help!'''
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story with two different endings?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} '💥ZAP!💥'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!🦖'
                    ```

            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put `{if}`, `{repeat}` or `{for}` commands inside other `{if}`, `{repeat}` or `{for}` commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```

            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'I see a ' animal ' looking at me'
                        {print} animal
                        {print} animal
                        {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {print} 'I see all the animals looking at me!'
                    ```

            12:
                story_text: In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    {print} name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly...'
                    ```
                start_code: '# place your code here'
            13:
                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own adventure minigame like this?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sword = 'lost'
                    game = 'on'
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 0 {to} 2
                        {if} game {is} 'on'
                            path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'

                                {print} 'Try again'
                                game = 'over'

                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game {is} 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword {is} 'lost'` so the player can't continu the game until they have found something.
                example_code: |

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    like {is} {ask} What is your favorite animal?
                    {add} like {to_list} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}

                    ## Remove from
                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    dislike {is} {ask} What animal do you not like?
                    {remove} dislike {from} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}

                    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two `{if}`s but can use `{and}` and `{or}`.

                    If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    ## The ask command
                    Now that you can use the `{print}` command, you are ready to learn the next command: `{ask}`. With the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question. Check it out:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!
                    {ask} What is your name?
                    {echo} hello
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Try out the `{ask}` and `{echo}` commands. Firstly, fill in the blanks to make this program work.
                    Then ask 2 more questions using the `{ask}` command, after each `{ask}` use an `{echo}` to print the answer on the screen.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    _ How are you doing?

                    ## The ask command
                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.
                    Check it out:

                    This way your code is becoming interactive!

                    name {is} {ask} What is your name?
                    {print} Hello name
                    age {is} {ask} How old are you?
                    {print} name is age years old.
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    In the previous tab you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous tab and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animals is ask What is your favorite animal?
                    print I like favorite_animals

                    {print} Hello name
                    age {is} {ask} How old are you?

                story_text: |
                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    Have fun!

                    This calculator game helps you practise your tables of multiplication!
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you add more numbers to the list, so you can practise all the multiplications?
                example_code: |

                    With a `{for}` you can simplify tables of multiplication practise program.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2 (extra)
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ## Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next tab!**

                    You can add the `{while}` loop to the calculator game you've learned to make in a previous level.
                    This makes sure the player can't continue to the next question {if} they answer incorrectly.
                example_code: |

                    ## Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous tab.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ## Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.

                    Nhập mã của bạn vào trường lập trình. Hoặc nhấn vào nút màu xanh trong khối mã ví dụ, và mã sẽ được gõ tự động cho bạn!
                    Hãy thử mã của bạn bằng cách sử dụng nút 'Chạy mã' màu xanh dưới trường lập trình.

                    Bạn có thể đặt tên cho một từ bằng cách sử dụng lệnh `{is}`. Điều này được gọi là biến. Trong ví dụ này, chúng tôi tạo ra một biến có tên là "name" và một biến có tên là "age". Bạn có thể sử dụng từ "name" bất kỳ nơi nào trong mã của bạn và nó sẽ được thay thế bằng "Hedy", như thế này:
                    Như vậy, bạn không cần sử dụng lệnh `{echo}` nữa!

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.

                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.

                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.

                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                     In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                     The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                     The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                     That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    You can now execute groups of code together, but you will have to *indent* the code.
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {print} people {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Don't feel like doing the dishes yourself? Hack the program by removing your name from the list with the `{remove}` `{from}` command.

                    With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing planning more beautiful.
                    This time the sample code is not quite complete.

                    Can you complete the code by filling the blanks? Every blank must be replaced with one word of symbol.

                    Tip: Don't forget the quotation marks!
                example_code: |

                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie

                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!
                example_code: "```\npeople {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie\ndishwasher {is} people {at} {random}\n{if} dishwasher {is} Sophie {print} _ too bad I have to do the dishes _ \n{else} {print} 'luckily no dishes because' _ 'is already washing up'\n```\n"

                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?
                story_text_2: |
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!

                    ### Exercise
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?
                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |4

                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?

                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.

                    ### Exercise

                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller {ask} 3 questions and also print them!

                    In this level you'll learn how to use **functions**. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.
                    To create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.
                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {print} 'Lets play a game of Twister!'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 to _
                        {call} turn
                        {sleep} 2
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    define song with place
                        print 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    call song with 'ocean'
                    call song with 'sea'
                    call song with 'ocean'
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    define song with place
                        print 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    call song with 'ocean'
                    call song with 'sea'
                    call song with 'ocean'

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ## Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.

                    define calculate_new_price with amount, percentage

                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = ask 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = ask 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price with old_price, _
                    print 'The new price is ' new_price ' dollar'
                    ```

                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = ask 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = ask 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Escape from the haunted house!
                    _ There are 3 doors in front of you...
                    _ _ _ Which door do you choose?
                    _ You picked door ... choice
                    monsters _ a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    _ You see...
                    {sleep}
                    _ _ _ _
                    ```

                    In this level you learn how to use quotation marks in your games.
                    Can you make your Haunted House level 4 proof?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} _ Escape from the haunted house! _
                    {print} _ There are 3 doors in front of you... _
                    choice {is} {ask} _ Which door do you choose? _
                    {print} _ You picked door ... _ choice
                    monsters {is} a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    {print} _ You see... _

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you find the 4 missing words to complete the code?

                    {print} 'There are 3 doors in front of you...'
                    doors {is} 1, 2, 3
                    monsters {is} werewolf, mummy, vampire, zombie
                    chosen_door {is} {ask} 'Which door do you choose?'
                    {print} 'You chose door...' chosen_door
                    {sleep}
                    correct_door {is} doors {at} {random}
                    _ _ _ _ {print} 'Great! Youve escaped!'
                    {else} {print} 'Oh no! You are being eaten by a...' monsters {at} {random}

                    In this level you can use nesting, which allows you to make the haunted house even more interactive!

                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door and 2 wrong ones?
                example_code: |

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple agruments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with {ask} commands.

                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.

                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animals`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we haved used the variable in a print command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animals is _
                    {print} I like favorite_animals
                    ```
                start_code: |-
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old

                story_text: |
                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
            14:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```
                start_code: |-
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'
                    {else}

                    In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    In this level there is another new keyword: `{pressed}`!
                    With `{pressed}` you can use keys on your keyboard to control what lines are used.

                    ### Exercise
                    Look at the example and add one more line of code that reacts to a key press.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    The code you have seen in level 5 only checks the key once. Copy the example code and add a `{repeat}` to it, so that you can press the keys many times.
                    Use this code to draw something nice.

                    Now that you know how to combine statements, you can create a touch type tool with `{pressed}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.
                    **(extra)** Clear the screen after each letter, and show the user how many points they have scored.

                    In this exercise you will see a pink blank space. You have to fill something in the place of the blank space before the code can be ran.

                    Fill in the `{print}` command in the blank space and then add five more lines of code. Each line has to start with a `{print}` command.

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` and `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!
                    In the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.
                    Give it a try!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes {repeat} 2 {times} {print} 'You knew that already!'
                    {else} {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'You have learned something new!'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ## Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'

                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'

                    In this level you've learned how to use the `{repeat}` command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to `{ask}` multiple people what they'd like to eat.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you fill in the blanks? Hedy needs to repeat this question as many times as there are people. So of there are 5 people, the question needs to be asked 5 times.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    people = {ask} 'How many people are joining us today?'
                    {repeat} _ {times} food = {ask} 'What would you like to eat?'
                    {print} 'Thanks for your order! Its coming right up!'
                    ```

                    In this level you can make your virtual restaurant more elaborate by repeating multiple lines of code. Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    people = {ask} 'How many people will be joining us today?'
                    {print} 'Great!'
                    {repeat} people {times}
                        food = {ask} 'What would you like to order?'
                        {print} food
                    {print} 'Thank you for ordering!'
                    {print} 'Enjoy your meal!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Of course, this code can be expanded with more items on the menu, offering drinks, and/or multiple courses, so feel free to add as many options as you like!

                    In this level you can use nesting to make your restaurant more realistic and more fun!
                    For example you would ask for sauce if somebody orders fries, but you wouldn't if someone orders pizza!

                    ### Exercise
                    This is a challenge for the real brainiacs! Each line that needs indentation has been given a blank.
                    Can you figure out how much indentation each line needs in order for the code to work propperly?
                    Good luck!
                    TIP: If the customer orders pizza, Hedy shouldn't ask what sauce the costumer wants.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    people = {ask} 'How many people will be joining us today?'
                    {print} 'Great!'
                    price = 0
                    {repeat} people {times}
                    _ food = {ask} 'What would you like to order?'
                    _ {print} food
                    _ {if} food {is} fries
                    _ price = price + 3
                    _ sauce = {ask} 'What kind of sauce would you like with your fries?'
                    _ {if} sauce {is} no
                    _ {print} 'no sauce'
                    _ {else}
                    _ price = price + 1
                    _ {print} 'with ' sauce
                    _ {if} food {is} pizza
                    _ price = price + 4
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollar'
                    {print} 'Enjoy your meal!'

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Of course, you could also order for multiple people!
                    Can you add the correct amount of indentation before each line to make the code work properly?
                    TIP: some lines don't need any indentation at all.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    _ courses = appetizer, main course, dessert
                    _ names = Timon, Onno
                    _ {for} name {in} names
                    _ {for} course {in} courses
                    _ food = {ask} name ', what would you like to eat as your ' course '?'
                    _ {print} name ' orders ' food ' as their ' course
                    ```
                start_code: courses = appetizer, main course, dessert
            11:

                    We can use the `{for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 5` to `{print}` the orders from multiple customers in an orderly manner.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you handle another indentation challenge? Get the code to work properly by adding the right amount of indentation before each line!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Restaurant Hedy!'
                    people = {ask} 'For how many people would you like to order?'

                    In this level we can enter lists and choose things from them.
                    You first make a list with `{is}`. Then you can let the computer choose something from the list with `{at} {random}`.
                    For example, you can let the computer pick from rock, paper and scissors.
                example_code: |

                    For that you need the new `{if}` code.

                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                    Then you can use `{if}` to see {if} they are the same or different.
                    Will you finish the code?

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

                    Tip: Use the read aloud function to let Hedy sing the song to you!

                    ### Exercise
                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 7 as many times as you want by copying the lines.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    sleep

                    This children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.
                    If you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the the code, you can sing the whole song!
                example_code_2: |

                    number = 6

                    print number ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'
                    print 'One fell off and bumped his head'
                    print 'Mama called the doctor and the doctor said'
                    print 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'
                    sleep
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Lets sing!'''

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    In this level, you can program a song like OldMacDonald even more quickly. You can connect the right animal to the right sound by simply putting them in the same place in the list.
                    The Drunken Sailor is also quickly made in this level. You only need 8 lines for the entire song, check it out!

                    In level 16 we made songs using lists. These programs however are no longer working properly in this level. The colons from level 17 and the brackets from level 18 still need to be added.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Now also look up your Old MacDonald song from level 16, and correct it.

                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                story_text: |
                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.

                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`

                    ### Exercise
                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 20
                    {turn} {right}
                    {forward} 20
                    {turn} {left}
                    {forward} 20
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use use `{at} {random}` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list.
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path?
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    In level 4 you have to use quotation marks with `{print}` and `{ask}`. Also when drawing!

                    ```
                    {print} _ Drawing figures _

                story_text_2: |
                    You can also change the color of the lines with the command `{color}`. Check out the example.
                    You can also use the command `{color} {white}` to make 'invisible' lines. You could use these white lines to move the turtle anywhere in the screen before you start drawing.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {color} {white}

                    Fill in the correct numbers in this code to get it to work.
                    After you've done that, you can try to add the option backwards.

                    **Extra** Instead of using 'left' and 'right', remake the program with North, East, South and West.
                    This way you could add even more directions like Northeast and Southwest etc.

                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles = {ask} 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle = 360 / angles
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    ```

                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angle = 90
                    {repeat} 10 {times}
                        {turn} angle
                        {forward} 50

                    Also, we can now improve the program that draws different figures.
                    Can you figure out how far the turtle has to turn here? Finish the code and you can draw any polygon you'd like!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    angles = {ask} 'How many angles should I draw?'
                    angle = 360 / angles
                    {repeat} angle {times}
                        {turn} _
                        {forward} _
                    ```

                    Now that we can use a `{repeat}` inside a `{repeat}`, we can create more complex figures.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **(extra)** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {color} {black}
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        {repeat} 3 {times}
                            {forward} 10
                            {turn} 120
                        {color} {white}
                        {forward} 50
                        {color} {black}

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!
                example_code: |

                    answer = 0
                    {while} answer != 25
