                    Az 1. szinten elkészíthetsz egy történetet egy másik főszereplővel, amelyet te magad adsz meg.

                    Az első sorba írt `{ask}` bekéri a történet főszereplőjének a nevét.

                    Az első sor után kezdd a `{print}` utasítással, ha a mondatot ki kell íratni.
                    Akkor használd az `{echo}` parancsot, ha azt szeretnéd, hogy főszereplő neve a mondat végén legyen.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} A történet főszereplője
                    {print} A főszereplő most az erdőben fog sétálni
                    {echo} Kicsit fél, szegény
                    {print} Őrült zajokat hall mindenütt
                    {print} Fél, hogy ez egy kísértet-járta erdő
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Tudsz saját történetet írni Hedy-ben a `{print}` , `{ask}` és `{echo}` használatával?

                    A 2. szinten szórakoztatóbbá teheted a történetedet. Fő karaktered neve mostantól
                    bárhol lehet a mondatban.

                    Ehhez egy kicsit fel kell javítanod a kódodat. Most először el kell nevezned a főszereplődet. Olyan nevet válassz, amely nem tartalmaz ékezetes betűt.

                    Ezt a nevet bárhol elhelyezheted a mondatban.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    nev is ask Mi a neve a főszereplőnek?

                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. Hozzáadhatsz valami véletlenszerűt is a történetéhez. Bármilyen szörnyet, állatot vagy más akadályt.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    allatok is bagoly, sündisznó, tatu
                    print Most hallja a allatok at random hangját
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story. For example
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} They hear a sound
                    animals {is} 🐿, 🦔, 🦇, 🦉
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code and finish it by adding quotation marks on the blanks in lines 1 and 2.
                    The blanks in line 3 and 4 should not be replaced by quotation marks, but a `{sleep}` and a `{clear}` command. Can you make it work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your story code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                    Mind: The variables in your own story should be outside of the quotation marks. Just like the second line of the example code. In that line the variable name is placed outside of the quotation marks.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} _ What is your name? _
                    {print}  _ The main character is called _ name
                    _
                    _
                    {print} name  _ is now going to walk in the woods _
                    {print} name _ is a bit scared _
                    animals {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} _ He hears the sound of a _ animals {at} {random}
                    {print} name _ is afraid this is a haunted forest _
                    ```

                    Amit a 4. szinten megtehetsz, az még szórakoztatóbbá varázsolja történetedet. A 4.
                    szinten a történethez különböző végződéseket programozhatsz.
                    Gondolj például a történet két különböző végére:
                    - A hercegnő sétál az erdőn
                    - Összefut egy szörnyeteggel
                    - Boldog befejezés: Előveszi a kardját, és a szörny gyorsan elszalad
                    - Rossz befejezés: A szörny megeszi a hercegnőt
                    Biztosíthatod azt is, hogy egy név újra beírható legyen. Ez ugyanúgy működik, mint a 3.
                    szinten. Kombinálhatod ezt egy `if`-fel, és akkor már készítettél is egy egész programot!
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    nev is ask 'Ki jár az erdőben?'
                    print nev ' sétál az erdőn'
                    print nev ' találkozik egy szörnnyel'
                    vege is ask ' Egy jó vagy rossz véget szeretnél?'
                    if vege is jó print nev ' előveszi a kardot és a szörny gyorsan elszalad' else print 'A szörny megeszi ' nev '-t'
                    ```

                    A történetben valaki bizonyos szavakat többször is elmond. Például, ha valaki segítséget kér vagy elénekel egy dalt.
                    Az ilyen ismétlést beírhatod a 6. szintbe tartozó történetbe a 'repeat' paranccsal.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    print 'A herceg folyamatosan segítséget kért'
                    repeat 5 times print 'Segítség!'
                    print 'Miért nem segít nekem senki?'

                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} '💥ZAP!💥'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!🦖'

            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'What do you see?'

                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.

                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continue the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise
                    The example code shows you how to use the `{while}` loop in a story. Now **think of your own scenario** in which the player has to find something before they can continue.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    {print} 'You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.'
                    {print} 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    {print} 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'
                    {while} keys == 'lost'
                        location = {ask} 'Where do you want to look?'
                        {if} location == 'flowerbed'
                            {print} 'Here they are!'
                            keys = 'found'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Nope they are not at the ' location
                    {print} 'Now you can enter the house!'

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    naam = {input}("What's your name?")

                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    like {is} {ask} What is your favorite animal?
                    {add} like {to_list} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ## Remove from
                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    dislike {is} {ask} What animal do you not like?
                    {remove} dislike {from} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}
                    ```

                    If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.

                    In the previous tab you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous tab and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.

                    ***Set the variables***
                    Start by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.

                    ***Create a function to calculate the points***
                    Create a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.
                    All the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.
                    Return the variable `points` at the end of the function.

                    ***Test the function***
                    Test if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.
                    Run the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results? Great! Then you can remove the testing part and move on the the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'BLACKJACK'

                    # Set these variables
                    cards = _
                    face_cards = _
                    card_1 =

                    # Create a function to calculate the points
                    {define} calculate_points {with} card:
                        {if} card {in} face_cards:
                            points = _
                        {elif} _
                            _
                        {else}:
                            _
                        _ points

                    # Test your function
                    {print} 'Your card is a ' _
                    {print} 'That is worth ' _ ' points'.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the second part of our Blackjack game.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure***
                    In the previous adventure you've started a list of variables and created a function to calculate how many points a card is worth. Copy your code and paste it here. Mind that you don't need the testing part, so if you haven't removed that yet, please do so now.

                    ***Add more variables***
                    You have already set the lists `cards` and `face_cards` and the variable `card_1`. Underneath those variables create 3 more variables: `card_2`, dealer_card_1` and `dealer_card_2`. These variables are all set to a random card from the list of cards.

                    ***Add up points***
                    To calculate how many points you have scored we call the function with card 1 and we do it again for card 2. Then we add both these scores together to get your total.
                    Do the same thing for the dealers points, but be sure to use the dealer's cards and not your own!

                    ***2 Aces***
                    You're doing great! Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.

                    ***Show the score***
                    Lastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is. Then show which cards the dealer has and how many points they have.

                    ***Continue in the next tab***
                    Great! You have finished this part of the game! Copy your code and go to the next tab to learn how to ask for an extra card and to declare a winner.
                example_code: |

                    card_2 = _
                    dealer_card_1 = _
                    dealer_card_2 = _

                    # Add up your points
                    your_points_1 = {call} _ {with} card_1
                    your_points_2 = _
                    your_total = _

                    # Add up the dealers points
                    dealer_points_1 = _
                    _
                    _

                    # 2 Aces
                    {if} card_1 == 'Ace' {and} _
                        your_total = 12
                    {if} dealer_card_1 _

                    # Show the score
                    {print} 'You have drawn a ' _ ' and a ' _ '. That is ' _ ' points'
                    {print} 'The dealer has drawn a ' _ ' and a ' _ '. That is ' _ ' points'

                    In the previous tabs you have learned how to draw 2 random cards for yourself and for the dealer and to calculate how many points you both got.
                    In this adventure we add the option to ask for an extra card for both you and the dealer.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Firstly, copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Extra card for you*** If you want, you can get an extra card to get your total as close to 21 as possible. First ask the player if they want an extra card.
                    If they do, pick a random card and print what they have drawn. If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.
                    In case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.
                    If your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.
                    If the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.
                    Lastly, print your new total of points.

                    ***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.
                    Copy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section. Then change it to fit the dealer picking an extra card and getting points added to their total.
                example_code: |

                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    In the last 3 adventures you have alsmost created a working blackjack game! The only thing left to do is to decide a winner!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Start by pasting the code that you've made so far into your programming field.

                    ***Decide a winner***
                    Firstly, if you and the dealer have an equal amount of points, it's a draw.
                    Secondly, if the dealer has more than 21 points and you don't, you are the winner.
                    Thirdly, if both you and the dealer have less than 22 points, we have to see who came closest to 21. We do that by comparing who has the highest score. Is your total higher than the dealer's total, then you are the winner. If not, the dealer wins.
                    Lastly, in all other scenarios (e.g. you have more than 21 points and the dealer doesn't, or you both have more than 21 points) you are the loser.

                    ***Enjoy the game!***
                    Does your game work properly? Amazing! You have done a great job! Enjoy your game!
                    If it doesn't work right away, no worries, you might have made a mistake. Just keep calm and bebug your code using the ladybug button.

                    Azt is engedélyezheted, hogy a számítógép véletlenszerű számításokat végezzen véletlenszámok használatával.

                    Így válassz ki pár táblázatot a gyakorláshoz, és ettől mindig más eredményt kapsz

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks. We want this program to ask the player these questions:
                    ```
                    How much is 1 times 1?
                    How much is 1 times 2?

                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.
                example_code: |

                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.

                    ```

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next tab!**

                            return _ / 4

                    You can add the `{while}` loop to the calculator game you've learned to make in a previous level.
                    This makes sure the player can't continue to the next question if they answer incorrectly.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the `{while}` loop in the function, ask the player what number_1 times number_2 is and print their answer.
                    Then `{call}` the function.
                example_code: |

                        number_1 = numbers {at} {random}
                        number_2 = numbers {at} {random}
                        correct = number_1 * number_2
                        answer = 0

                    ### Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous tab.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.

                    Time for a new command! With `{clear}` you can clear all the text form your output screen. This way you can prevent your screen getting too full of text.
                    Beware! If you are using a `{clear}` command, you might need to use a `{sleep}` above it. Otherwise Hedy will clear your screen without giving you the time to read as you can see in the example!

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.
                    Fix this program to turn it into the nursery rhyme 'Brother John (Frère Jaques)' by using the {repeat} command of course!

                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender
                    Here are all the days of November

                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    Congratulations! You've reached level 2. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes!
                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time.
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    So let's go to the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    **Warning! This code does not work!**
                    In Hedy commands will change sometimes. `{echo}` for example only works in level 1. In this level you'll learn a better way to echo answers back.
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want
                    ```

                    A 3. szinten készíthetsz listát is. Kérheted a számítógépet, hogy véletlenszerűen válasszon valamit a listából. Ezt a `{at} {random}` paranccsal teheted meg.
            4:
                story_text: |
                    A 4. szinten a `{ask}` és a `{print}` máshogy működik.
                    Amit ki akarsz íratni, idézőjelbe kell tenned.
                    Ez hasznos, mert most már mindent kiírathatsz, amit csak akarsz, azokat a szavakat is, amiket arra használtál, hogy eltárolj valamit az `{is}` paranccsal.
                    A legtöbb programozási nyelv idézőjelet használ a kiíratáshoz, így egy kicsit közelebb kerülünk az igazi programozáshoz!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} "Mostantól idézőjeleket kell használni!"
                    válasz {is} {ask} "Miket kell mostantól használni?"
                    {print} válasz " kell használni."
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Az 5. szinten újdonság következik, a `{if}`! A `{if}` paranccsal két lehetőség közül választhatsz.
                    Ez a kód kiírja, hogy klassz, ha a Hedy nevet adod meg névként, és fújt, ha valami mást írsz be.
                    A `{ask}` és `{print}` ugyanúgy működnek, mint a 4. szinten.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    név {is} {ask} "Hogy hívnak?"
                    {if} név {is} Hedy {print} "klassz" {else} {print} "fúj!"
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Ezen a szinten új dolgot tanulunk: számolni.

                    Az összeadás könnyű, ugyanúgy írod, mint a matekban: `5 + 5`. A kivonás is jól működik, így írjuk: `5 - 5`.

                    A szorzás egy kicsit különbözik, ugyanis nincs szorzásjel a billentyűzeten. Nézd meg, tényleg nincs!
                    Ezért használjuk a csillagot: `5 * 5`. Olvasd ezt "5-ször 5"-nek, így könnyen megjegyzed.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} "5 plusz 5 egyenlő " 5 + 5
                    {print} "5 mínusz 5 egyenlő " 5 - 5
                    {print} "5-ször 5 egyenlő " 5 * 5
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    A 7. szinten bemutatkozik az `{repeat}` parancs. Ezzel egy sort többször végrehajthatsz.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} "A Hedy szórakoztató!"

                story_text: |
                    A `{ask}` és a `{print}` még mindig úgy működik, ahogyan ismered. De a `{if}`, `{else}` és az `{repeat}` utasítások megváltoztak!
                    Most különböző utasítások egy csoportját futtathatod egyszerre, de behúzással tagolnod kell a kódot.
                    Ez azt jelenti, hogy négy szóközt kell tennünk a sor elejére. Ez akkor is érvényes, ha csak egy soros blokkot akarsz létrehozni.
                example_code: |
                    Így működik mostantól az `{repeat}` parancs:

                        {print} "Sziasztok"
                        {print} "Ez 5-ször ismétlődik"
                    ```
                    Így működik mostantól a `{if}` és az `{else}` parancs:

                    ```
                    név {is} {ask} "Hogy hívnak?"
                    {if} név {is} Hedy
                        {print} "Szia Hedy!"
                        {print} "Játszhatsz a számítógéppel."
                    {else}
                        {print} "BEHATOLÓ!"
                        {print} "Nem használhatod ezt a gépet!"
                    ```

                        {print} "Sziasztok"
                        {print} "Ez 5-ször lett kiírva"

                    Ezen a szinten már nemcsak több soros `{if}` és `{repeat}` parancsokat használhatsz, hanem egymásba is teheted őket.
                    A példában egy `{if}` van egy `{repeat}` parancson belül. Fordítva is lehet csinálni, és még `{if}` is lehet `{if}` `{if}` parancsba ágyazva, vagy `{repeat}` `{repeat}`-be.

                    A `{for}` is létrehoz egy blokkot, pont úgy, ahogy az `{repeat}` és `{if}`, ezért az összes sort a blokkban szóközökkel kell kezdeni.

                    A `<` ellenőrzi, hogy az első szám kisebb-e, mint a második, például kor `<` 12 megmondja, hogy a kor kisebb-e, mint 12.

                    A `>` ellenőrzi, hogy az első szám nagyobb-e, mint a második, például pontszám `>` 10 megmondja, hogy a pontszám nagyobb-e, mint 10.

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 10
                        {print} counter

                story_text: |
                    Now we are going to change indentation a little bit. Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 10:
                        {print} i

                    Voltál már fesztiválon, és egy jósnő megjósolta a jövődet? Vagy játszottál már varázslatos nyolc labdával?
                    Akkor valószínűleg tudod, hogy nem igazán tudják megjósolni a jövődet, de ettől még szórakoztató játszani!

                    A következő szinteken megtanulhatod, hogyan kell saját jósnőt létrehozni!
                    Az 1. szinten könnyen kezdheted, ha hagyod, hogy Hedy jósnőként mutatkozzon be, és hagyja, hogy visszhangozza a játékosok válaszait.
                    Mint ez:
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    Hedy most csak a nevedet mondja meg. Ki tudod bővíteni a kódot, hogy Hedy több dolgot meg tudjon jósolni rólad?

                    Nyilvánvaló, hogy Hedy még nem túl jó jósnő, hiszen csak meg tudja ismételni a játékosok által adott válaszokat!
                    Vess egy pillantást a 2. szintre, hogy fejleszd a jósnődet.

                    Cseréld le Hedyt a saját nevedre az utolsó sorban, és Hedy mindig azt jósolja, hogy te nyersz a lottón, mások nem!
                    Természetesen ez gyanakvást kelthet a többi játékossal szemben ... Ennek elkerülése érdekében gondoskodhatsz arról, hogy Hedy minden alkalommal más válaszokat adjon a kód futtatásakor.
                    De természetesen neked továbbra is pozitív választ ad, a többi játékosnak pedig negatív választ.

                    Ezeb az elven különféle programokat lehet készíteni, csak légy kreatív! Például létrehozhatsz egy olyan gépet, amely megjósolja, hogy kedvenc sportcsapatod legyőzi az összes versenytársat!

                    Az 6. szinten a `repeat` paranccsal beállíthatod, hogy a gép egyszerre több jóslatot mondjon.

                    Amint láthatod, a kérdések ebben a példában nincsenek kiíratva. Ennek az az oka, hogy a `kérdés` változót háromszor módosult.
                    Valahányszor a játékos kitölti az új választ, Hedy felülírja az előzőt, így a játékos első válaszát elfelejti.
                    Ez azt jelenti, hogy így nem tudja kiíratni az összes kérdést.

                    Ha 1 helyett 3 különböző változót használsz (például `kerdes1`,` kerdes2` és `kerdes3`), megoldhatod a problémát, és kiírathatod a kérdéseket.
                    Ez azt jelenti, hogy a válaszoknál csak az "repeat" utasítást kell használnod, és az összes kérdést külön kell feltenned és ki kell íratnod.

                    In this level you'll learn how to use **functions**. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.
                    To create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.
                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {print} 'Lets play a game of Twister!'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 to _
                        {call} turn
                        {sleep} 2
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} song {with} place
                        {print} 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    {call} song {with} 'sea'
                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    ```

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _
                    {print} 'The new price is ' new_price ' dollar'
                    ```

                    Let's make functions the Pythons way! To define a function, we no longer use:

                    `{define} name_function {with} argument_1, argument_2:`

                    but we use:

                    `{def} name_function(argument_1, argument_2):`.


                    If you don't want to use arguments, you just leave the space between the parantheses empty.
                    To call a function, we don't need the `{call}` command anymore. You just type the name of the function.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    In this adventure we program a game of hangman. First we make some preparations, then we program the game and in the third part we add a drawing with the turtle.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Set the variables*** In this game of hangman, Player 1 chooses an answer and Player 2 has to guess the letters in this answer.
                    To let the computer know all the letters in the word, we will turn the answer into a list of letters. We also do this with the guesses Player 2 makes.
                    We will start the game with 2 empty lists. We have made an empty list for the variable answer for you. Now make an empty list for guessed_letters as well.
                    Then we fill in how many mistakes were made. At the start of the game, this should be 0.
                    The variable `amount_letters` tells us how many letters are in the answer. Ask Player 1 to tell us how many letters their word has.
                    Lastly we tell the computer if the game is over. We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.

                    ***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.
                    Then we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.

                    ***Player 2's turn***
                    Tell Player 2 its their turn. Then tell Player 2 how many letters there are in the answer. Finally, print the list of `guessed_letters`.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Now that all the starting variables are set, we can start programming the game itself. Check out the next tab to learn how!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'Hangman!'

                    # Set the variables
                    answer = []
                    guessed_letters = _
                    mistakes_made = _
                    amount_letters = {ask} _
                    _ = 'False'

                    # Choosing the answer
                    {for} _
                        letter = {ask} 'Player 1, what is letter ' i '?'
                        _
                        {add} '_' {to} _

                    # Player 2 turn
                    print _
                    print _
                    print guessed_letters

                    Now it's time to program the hangman game.

                    ### Exercise

                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste the code in the programming field.

                    ***The game*** This games continues playing until Player 2 is game over. Fill in the while command accordingly. Now, Player 2 is allowed to guess a letter, so ask Player 2 to guess a letter.
                    We need to check if their answer is correct, so check if their `guess` is (somewhere) in the (list) `answer`. Then we let the computer figure out which of the letter(s) is the guess. We have already programmed that part for you.
                    Next we want to compliment the player for finding a correct letter and we want to print the list `guessed_letters`, so the player can see their progress.

                    The next part we're going to program is what happens when the player has guessed all of the letters. So if their list of `guessed_letters` is the same as our list `answer`.
                    If the lists are the same, congratulate Player 2 with their victory and set the variable `game_over` to `True`.

                    Next we'll program what happens when Player 2 guesses wrong (so the `{else}` command). First, tell the player that their guess was wrong. Then increase the `mistakes_made` variable by 1.

                    For the last part we'll program what happens when Player 2 has made 10 mistakes. We'll print that Player 1 has won the game. Then we'll print the correct answer. And finally, we'll set our `game_over` variable to `True`, so the game stops.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Amazing work! Your game is playable, but wouldn't it be fun if the hangman was actually drawn when Player 2 makes a mistake..?

                    In a game of hangman the mistakes are shown by drawing a part of the hangman each time a mistake has been made.
                    We now add those drawings with our turtle!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Create a function that draws the hangman*** Create a function that draws the hangman in 10 steps. We have already made step 1 for you.

                    ***Test the function*** Test the function by calling the function with 10. If you are happy with the function, remove the line that calls the function for now. We will call the function when the player makes a mistake.

                    ***Paste your hangman game under your function*** Go back to the previous tab and copy your hangman game. Paste the game underneath your function.

                    ***Call the function when the player makes a mistake*** Under the line `mistakes_made = mistakes_made + 1` we will call the function. We want the turtle to take the same amount of steps as the player has made mistakes, so we call the function with `mistakes_made` as argument.

                    ***Enjoy your game!***

                    Ebben a kalandban egy olyan játék létrehozásán dolgozol, amelyben a megfelelő ajtó kiválasztásával menekülnöd kell egy kísértetjárta házból.
                    Ha a megfelelő ajtót választod, túléled, de ha nem, egy rettenetes szörnyeteg ...

                    Az 1. szinten elkezdjük a kísértetjárta ház játékunkat egy ijesztő történet kitalálásával, és megkérdezzük a játékost, hogy milyen szörnyet látnak a kísértetjárta házban.

                    print és hirtelen minden elsötétült.
                    print De hogy kerületem a padlóra...?
                    print és fejem úgy fáj, mintha egy baseball ütővel ütötték volna meg!

                    print Ó, nem! Úgy érzem, nem vagyok egyedül ebben a házban!
                    print El kell mennem innen!
                    print Három ajtó van előttem ...
                    ask Melyik ajtót válasszam?

                    A 2. szinten interaktívabbá teheted a történetet a játék kimenetelének megváltoztatásával; néha megesznek, néha megmenekülsz!
                    Hadd döntsön Hedy véletlenszerűen!


                    Ez a történet meglehetősen egyszerű, talán egy kicsit érdekesebbé teheted egy izgalmasabb történet hozzáadásával.
                    Továbbá nagyon korlátozott eredményeket érhetsz el, csak 3 lehetőség van arra, hogy mi van az ajtók mögött. Talán még több szörnyetegre gondolhatsz, amelyet felvehetsz a listába!

                    Végezetül szeretnénk egy kihívást küldeni Neked,  hogy változtasd meg ezt a játékot olyan játékműsorrá (mint amilyenek a tévében vannak), ahol a játékosok ajtót vagy bőröndöt választanak, és valamelyik nagy díjat tartalmaz!
                    Meg tudod csinálni?

                    Abban az esetben, ha a játékos teljesen véletlenszerű választ adott, a játék továbbra is működne, és a játékos akár nyerhet is (annak ellenére, hogy nem választott ajtót).

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple agruments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with {ask} commands.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} welcome_message {with} title, last_name, country, room_number
                        {print} 'Welcome to Hotel Hedy, ' title ' ' last_name
                        nice_trip {is} {ask} 'Did you have a nice trip from, ' country '?'
                        {if} nice_trip {is} 'yes'
                            {print} 'Lovely!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Sorry to hear that.'
                            {print} 'Hopefully you can take a nice rest in you room.'
                        {print} 'Your room number is ' room_number

                    {print} 'Hello. Please fill in your information to check in.'
                    title = {ask} 'What is your title (mr, mrs, ms, dr, etc.)?'
                    name = {ask} 'What is you last name?'
                    homecountry = {ask} 'What country do you come from?'

                    {call} welcome_message {with} title, name, homecountry, 105
                    ```

                    title = {ask} 'What is your title (mr, mrs, ms, dr, etc.)?'
                    name = {ask} 'What is you last name?'
                    homecountry = {ask} 'What country do you come from?'

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice'
                    {else} {print} 'boo!'
                    ```

                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} '2 + 2 = ?'
                    _ _ _ 4 _ 'Great job!'
                    _ _ 'No 2 + 2 = 4'

                    ## If... Else...
                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an {else} command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy
                        {print} 'Welcome Hedy'
                        {print} 'You can play on your computer!'
                    ```

                    This code prints pretty! if you choose green or yellow, and meh otherwise.
                example_code: |

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animal`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we haved used the variable in a print command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} _
                    {print} I like favorite_animal
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```

                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'You are older than me!'

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    Type `{play}` followed by the note you want to play. The scale goes C-D-E-F-G-A-B.
                    As you can see there are 7 different letters, but we can play more than just 7 notes.
                    Type a number between 1 and 10 behind the letter to choose the scale, for example after B4 comes C5.
                    C1 is the lowest note you can play, C10 is the highest.

                    The example code creates a random melody, but it's very short and not many notes are used.
                    Add more notes to the list and create a longer melody by copying the last line a couple more times.

                    You don't always have to use the `{play}` command to play a whole song, sometimes you just want to play one note.
                    For example, if you want to make a quiz, you can play a happy high note if the answer is right and a sad low note if the answer is wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the first question by adding a line of code that plays a C3 note if the wrong answer is given.
                    Then think of 3 more questions to add to this quiz.

                    Firstly, add colons to get the code to work.
                    Then finish this code by adding at least 2 other songs for other moods. For example a happy song and an angry song.

                    In this level there is another new keyword: `{pressed}`!
                    With `{pressed}` you can use keys on your keyboard to control what lines are used.

                    ### Exercise
                    Look at the example and add one more line of code that reacts to a key press.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Do you want a good (g) or bad (b) ending?'

                    You can also link turtle commands to keys.

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the lines a few times so you can create a larger drawing.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                    The code you have seen in level 5 only checks the key once. Copy the example code and add a `{repeat}` to it, so that you can press the keys many times.
                    Use this code to draw something nice.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {if} x {is} {pressed} {forward} 15 {else} {turn} 90

                    Now that you know how to combine statements, you can create a touch type tool with `{pressed}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.
                    **(extra)** Clear the screen after each letter, and show the user how many points they have scored.
                example_code: |

                    In this exercise you will see a pink blank space. You have to fill something in the place of the blank space before the code can be run.

                    Fill in the `{print}` command in the blank space and then add five more lines of code. Each line has to start with a `{print}` command.

                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'
                    {print} 'We need to use ' answer

                    ## Contractions
                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.
                    Check out the example code to see the wrong way of using apostrophes.

                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Black Widow'.

                    In this level you can make a list using the `{is}` command. You can let the computer choose a random item from that list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code. The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']

                    {print} friends[2] ' is the second friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[3] ' is the third friend on the list.'
                    #now we will match 2 lists using the variable i
                    lucky_numbers = [15, 18, 6]
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 3
                        {print} friends[i] 's lucky number is ' lucky_numbers[i]

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ``` Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.

                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'

                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'
                    _ {repeat} 2 {times}
                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    Add the quotation marks to this code to make it work! Be careful: variables should not be in quotation marks.
                    Then, use the `{clear}` command to only show one line at a time in your output screen.

                    ### Exercise 2

                    A 6. szinten matematikai számításokkal kiszámíthatod az ügyfelek megrendelésének teljes árát, ami reálisabbá teheti a virtuális éttermet.

                    Készíthetsz egyszerű éttermi kódot, például.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'Üdvözlünk a Hedy Étteremben'
                    print 'Ez a menünk:'
                    print 'Fő ételeink: pizza, lasagne vagy spagetti'
                    foetel is ask 'Melyik főételt szeretnéd?'
                    ar is 0
                    if foetel is pizza ar is 1000
                    if foetel is lasagne ar is 1200

                    print 'Köszönöm, jó étvágyat!'
                    ```

                    De még sok mindent hozzáadhatsz a virtuális éttermedhez, például több tanfolyamot.

                    Ebben a példában három tanfolyam létezik, amelyek több kódot és további kiegészítéseket igényelnek az ár kiszámításakor.

                    Hozzáadhatsz még sok mindent a virtuális éttermedhez, például:
                    - kérdezd meg, hány ember jön, és szorozd meg az árat ezzel az értékkel
                    - felveszel egy másik ételt?
                    - kedvezményt adsz az embereknek, amikor (titkos) kuponkódot adnak meg?
                    - adsz hozzá gyermekmenüt?
                    - gondolsz más szórakoztató dolgokra?

                    Let's make a game of Simon Says! Simon Says is a memory game in which the player will be given a color. They have to repeat that color back.
                    If they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.

                    ***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
                    Then make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.
                    At the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.

                    ***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.
                    We do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.
                    Then create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.

                    ***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).
                    So we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.

                    ***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.
                    Remove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next tab to learn more about the simon says game!

                    ***Create a function that creates the player_sequence*** The list `player_sequence` is used to capture the answers of the player. First we define the function with the argument level.
                    Next, we ask level times what the color is that they choose. We call that variable `answer`. Then we add the variable `answer` to the list player_sequence.

                    ***Setting up the game*** Before we program the game in the next tab, we'll need some starting variables. First, we'll set the variable `level` to 1 and the variable `game_over` to False.
                    Then we make an introduction for the game. We'll print 'Welcome to Simon Says!' and clear the screen after 1 second.

                    ***Continue to the next tab to finish the game!**** Don't forget to copy your code and take it with you to the next tab.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Program the game*** We start by making sure the game goes on while the game isn't over. Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.
                    Now, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself. To create the list we use the same trick as we did in the previous tab.
                    We'll make a list with the words 'empty' and 'list' on it, and then we remove both these words. Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.
                    Lastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).
                    If that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.
                    Did the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'

                    A dalok gyakran sok ismétlést tartalmaznak. Néha az ismétlés alapja a számlálás is.
                    Például a jól ismert dalban „üveg sör”. Programozhatod azt a dalt egy kis matekkal.

                    Most megismételheted a 2–9. Sort, ahányszor csak akarod, a sorok másolásával.

                    # Előretekintve
                    Az 5. szinten megtanultunk 1 sort megismételni az `repeat` szóval, így:

                    * repeat 3 times print 'Baby Shark Tutududududu'

                    De ahogyan ebben a leckében látni fogod, néha több sort is meg akarsz együtt ismételni. Ezt meg lehet tenni vágással és beillesztéssel, de ez sok munka. A 7. szinten megtanulod, hogyan kell ezt könnyebben megtenni.

                    In this adventure you can program a game of Tic Tac Toe. You can play with two people. Taking turns, you pick a number of the spot (1 - 9) you want to put your sign (x or o) on.
                    The first player that gets 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins!
                    Have fun!

                    In this level you can improve your Tic Tac Toe game with the {while} loop/ With this loop you can combine the `{if} game != 'over'` and the `{for} i {in} {range} 1 to 9` into one simple line.

                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                    ### Exercise
                    Create a program that asks the player how many corners their figure should have and then creates that figure.
                    The figure in the image is the output when the player fills in 10.

                    <div class="w-full flex flex-row gap-2">

                    A star is usually drawn using 144-degree-turns. If you change this slightly to 143 degrees for example and repeat the pattern multiple times with a {while} loop you can make this figure.

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!

                    In this level you can use the `{for} i {in} {range}` command to countdown to the New Year.

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work!
