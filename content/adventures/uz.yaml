Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.\nThe Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.\nIf you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.\nBut be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!\nThe player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!\n\n### Exercise\nIn this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.\n\n***Set the variables***\nStart by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.\n\n***Create a function to calculate the points***\nCreate a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.\nAll the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.\nReturn the variable `points` at the end of the function.\n\n***Test the function***\nTest if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.\nRun the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results?

Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.\n\n***Show the score***\nLastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is.

Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.\nTo use 'place' we have placed `{with} place` after `{define} song`.\nWhen the function is called, the computer will replace the argument 'place', with the piece of text after `{call} song {with}`.\n\n### Exercise\nThe next verse of this song goes:\n\n```not_hedy_code\nLast night as I lay on my pillow\nLast night as I lay on my bed\nLast night as I lay on my pillow\nI dreamed that my Bonnie is dead\n```\n\nCan you program this verse in the same way as the example?\n"

Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.\nTo create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.\nLeave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!\n\nNow, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.\n\nCheck out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.\n\n### Exercise\nFinish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.\nThen, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.\n\n### Exercise 2\nImprove your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.\nFor example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.\n"

We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.\n\n***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.\nThen we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.\n\n***Player 2's turn***\nTell Player 2 its their turn.

If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.\nIn case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.\nIf your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.\nIf the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.\nLastly, print your new total of points.\n\n***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.\nCopy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section.

They have to repeat that color back.\nIf they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.\n\n### Exercise\nIn this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.\n\n***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.\nThen make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.\nAt the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.\n\n***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.\nWe do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.\nThen create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.\n\n***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).\nSo we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.\n\n***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.\nRemove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next tab to learn more about the simon says game!\n"

Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.\nNow, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself.

Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.\nLastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).\nIf that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.\nDid the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'\n\n***Enjoy your game!*** Great job!
