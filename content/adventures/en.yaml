            1:
                story_text: |
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    In the first line, use `{ask}` and ask who the main character of the story will be.

                    After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} The main character of this story is
                    {print} The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    {echo} They're a bit scared,
                    {print} They hear crazy noises everywhere
                    {print} They're afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now create your own story of at least 6 lines of code.
                    This story cannot be the same as the example code.
                    Use at least one `{ask}` and one `{echo}` command.
                    You can make it about any topic you like.
                    If you can't think of a topic, use one of our choices: going to the movies, a sports match or a day at the zoo.
            2:
                story_text: |
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} What is the name of the main character?
                    {print} name is now going to run in the woods
                    {print} name is a bit scared
                    {print} Suddenly she hears a crazy noise...
                    {sleep}
                    {print} name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a `{sleep}` command to your code to build up tension in your story.
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can use randomness for any monster, animal or other obstacle, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} They now hear the sound of an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} They hear a sound
                    animals {is} 🐿, 🦔, 🦇, 🦉
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy your story from the previous levels into this level.
                    In this level you've learned 3 new commands `{at} {random}` , `{add} {to_list}` and `{remove} {from}`.
                    Add new lines of code to your story, so that all of the new commands are featured at least once in your story.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code and finish it by adding quotation marks on the blanks in lines 1 and 2.
                    The blanks in line 3 and 4 should not be replaced by quotation marks, but a `{sleep}` and a `{clear}` command. Can you make it work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your story code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                    Mind: The variables in your own story should be outside of the quotation marks. Just like the second line of the example code. In that line the variable name is placed outside of the quotation marks.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} _ What is your name? _
                    {print} _ The main character is called _ name
                    _
                    _
                    {print} name _ is now going to walk in the woods _
                    {print} name _ is a bit scared _
                    animals {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} _ He hears the sound of a _ animals {at} {random}
                    {print} name _ is afraid this is a haunted forest _
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.
                    In the example code you can see how to make 2 different endings.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Write a new short story of at least 6 lines of code about a topic of your choosing.
                    No inspiration? Choose one of these topics: a superhero, a boring school day, stranded on a desert island.

                    Now give the player a change to choose a happy or a bad end, just like in the example code.
                    Program both the endings.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Copy the story you've created in your own story adventure in the previous levels.
                    Find a way to add at least 2 `{if}` and `{else}` commands to your story.
                    This can be with a happy or bad ending, but you can also try to find other ways to incorporate the commands.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name ' walks through the forest'
                    {print} name ' encounters a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name ' takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats ' name
                    ```


            6:
                story_text: |-
                    Now that you can use `{elif}` you can create an even more interactive story! You could create multiple characters for example, that all have different traits.
                    Or you could have your player choose which road to take, which door to open, or which magical potion to drink...

                    ### Exercise
                    Create your own story with 3 or more options using the {elif}.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    character {is} {ask} 'Who will help you on your quest?'
                    {if} character {is} 'Daisy'
                    {print} 'You have picked Daisy! She is the smartest of them all!'
                    {elif} character {is} 'Jason'
                    {print} 'You have picked Jason! He is the strongest of them all!'
                    {elif} character {is} 'Sam'
                    {print} 'You have picked Sam! They are the quickest of them all!'
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add repetition to your own story. Go back to your saved programs, choose your story program from a previous level and
                    find a line containing `{print}` and repeat it!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your `{if}` commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The example code shows two different endings; one where the characters jump in a time machine and one where they do not.
                    Complete the blanks with at least one sentence per ending.
                    **Extra** Make the story longer. What happens in the story? You can also add a second `{ask}` with different options.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your saved programs, choose your story program from level 5. Now write a good and a bad ending of at least three lines long each!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} _
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Oh no! Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} _
                    ```

                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can make your stories more versatile. You can ask two questions and respond to the combination of answers.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Look at the example code and finish it. Then add at least 2 more `{if}` codes with `{and}` or `{or}`.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Find a story from a previous level, and add one `{and}` or `{or}`.
                    example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'
                    weapon = {ask} 'What weapon does she draw?'
                    {if} path {is} 'left' {and} weapon {is} 'sword'
                        _

            11:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the `{for}` command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'Brown bear, Brown bear, what do you see'.

                    ### Exercise

                    Look at <a href="https://www.yonkerspublicschools.org/cms/lib/NY01814060/Centricity/Domain/1621/Brown%20Bear%20Book.pdf"> the story</a> if you do not know it, and make sure it is printed as in the book.

                story_text: |
                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continue the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise
                    The example code shows you how to use the `{while}` loop in a story. Now **think of your own scenario** in which the player has to find something before they can continue.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    {print}('You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.')
                    {print}('Where do you want to look for them?')
                    {print}('You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox')
                    {while} keys == 'lost':
                        location = {input}('Where do you want to look?')
                        {if} location == 'flowerbed':
                            {print}('Here they are!')
                            keys = 'found'
                        {else}:
                            {print}('Nope they are not at the ', location)
                    {print}('Now you can enter the house!')

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!

                    Now that you can use the `{print}` command, you are ready to learn the next command: `{ask}`. With the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question. Check it out:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!

                    ## The `{echo}` command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer back to you, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!
                    {ask} What is your name?
                    {echo} hello
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Try out the `{ask}` and `{echo}` commands. Firstly, fill in the blanks to make this program work.
                    Then ask 2 more questions using the `{ask}` command, after each `{ask}` use an `{echo}` to print the answer on the screen.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    _ How are you doing?

                    ## The `{ask}` command
                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.
                    Check it out:

                    This way your code is becoming interactive!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} What is your name?
                    {print} Hello name
                    age {is} {ask} How old are you?
                    {print} name is age years old.
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    In the previous adventure you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a `{print}` command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous adventure and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} {ask} What is your favorite animal?
                    {print} I like favorite_animal
                    ```
            13:
                story_text: The final change we will need to make to get Python code is changing `{ask}` into `{input}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('My name is Hedy!')

                    If you use `{and}`, then both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total divided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next adventure!**

                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous adventure.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: {define} calculate_mean_grade {with} subject.

                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer1 = {ask} 'What is 10 times 7?'
                    answer2 = {ask} 'What is 6 times 7?'
                    {if} _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                        {print} _
                    ```

                    Time for a new command! With `{clear}` you can clear all the text from your output screen. This way you can prevent your screen getting too full of text.
                    Beware! If you are using a `{clear}` command, you might need to use a `{sleep}` above it. Otherwise Hedy will clear your screen without giving you the time to read as you can see in the example!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} '3'
                    {clear}
                    {print} '2'

The code you have created here can be copied to real Python environments like Replit or PyCharm, and you can continue learning there! Note however that Python can only read English commands, so if you have been using other languages, you will need to switch to English now.

                    In this level we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.
                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    ![Die of earthworms with 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/felienne/hedy@24f19e9ac16c981517e7243120bc714912407eb5/coursedata/img/dobbelsteen.jpeg)

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    The dice in the example above are dice for a specific game. Can you make normal dice?
                    Or other special dice from a different game?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                    In this level you can also create dice. But this time you can try it yourself, without an example code!

                    ### Exercise
                    Make your own dice in this level.
                    Tip: If you have no idea how to make dice. Take a peek at your dice from the previous level, but don't forget to add quotation marks.

                story_text: |
                    We are going to add the `{if}` and `{else}` commands to our dice!

                    ### Exercise
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm. It should say "You have to throw again" if you've thrown anything else.
                    **Extra** Maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction, e.g. 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices {is} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw {is} choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you have thrown ' throw
                    _ throw {is} earthworm {print} 'You can stop throwing.'
                    _ {print} 'You have to throw it again!'
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in this, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to copy and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw ' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm
                    points = points + 5
                    {else}
                    points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are ' points ' points'
                    ```
                example_code_2: |
                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of copy and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!
            8:
                story_text: |
                    You can also make a dice again in this level. With the `{repeat}` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.

                    ### Exercise
                    Try to finish the sample code! **Extra** Think of a game you know that involves a dice and program that using a `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise
                    In this level you can create a little game in which you'll have to throw 6 as fast as possible.
                    We have started the code, it's up to you to get the game to work!

                    Firstly, add a `{while}` loop that checks if 6 has been thrown or not.
                    As long as you haven't thrown 6 already, throw the dice on a random number.
                    Print what the player has thrown.
                    Add a try to the amount of tries
                    Wait a second before you throw again, or - in case you've thrown a 6 - before the game ends.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
                    {print} 'Throw 6 as fast as you can!'
                    thrown = 0
                    tries = 0
                    _
                    _
                    _
                    _
                    _
                    {print}('Yes! You have thrown 6 in ', tries, ' tries.')

                    Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?
                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in this level!
                example_code: |

                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Make your own version of the dishwasher program. Firstly make a list of your family members.
                    Then think of a task that needs to be done, and let the computer decide who has to do the task with the `{at} {random}` command.

                    **Extra** Don't feel like doing the dishes yourself? Hack the program by removing your name from the list with the `{remove}` `{from}` command.

                    With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing program even better.

                    ### Exercise
                    First, fill in right symbols or commands on the blanks to make this example program work.
                    Did you get it? Great! Now copy your own code from the previous level and make it work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {print} _ the dishes are done by _
                    {sleep}
                    {print} people {at} _
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher {is} people {at} {random}
                    _ dishwasher {is} Sophie {print} _ too bad I have to do the dishes _
                    _ {print} 'luckily no dishes because ' _ ' is already washing up'
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma
                    emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?
                story_text_2: |
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to do the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again until everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and Tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And… can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'Monday the dishes are done by: ' dishwasher
                    {remove} dishwasher {from} people
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'Tuesday the dishes are done by: ' dishwasher
                    {remove} dishwasher {from} people
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    With the `{repeat}` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for multiple days!
                    ### Exercise
                    Use the `{repeat}` command to decide on who needs to wash the dishes for an entire week. Each blank needs to be filled with one command or number!
                    **Extra** Can you think of other tasks in the house? Adapt the code so it decides on three household chores. Do not forget to print what tasks it concerns!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie

                    ### Exercise
                    Add a second chore, such as vacuuming or tidying up, and make sure it is also divided for the whole week.
                    <br> **Extra** The program is not fair, you can be unlucky and wash up all week. How could you make the program more fair?

                    In this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is a combination of the keywords `{else}` and `{if}` and you need it when you want to make 3 (or more!) options.
                    Check it out!
                    ### Exercise

                    ## For
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = dog, cat, blobfish

                story_text: |
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her `{echo}` the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    _ Who are you?
                    _ Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    _ I see... I see...
                    _ Your name is
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code into your input screen and fill in the blanks to make the code work.
                    **Extra** Change the code and let the fortune teller not only predict your name, but also your age, your favorite sports team or something else about yourself.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only `{echo}`.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

                    ### Exercise
                    We have removed all the quotation marks from this example code, can you add them in all the right places?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your fortune teller code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Add the quotation marks to this code _
                    {print} Im Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is your question:  question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}

                    ### Exercise
                    In the example code you see how to make a fortune teller program that allows you to tip the odds in your favor. This cheating program always tells you that you will win the lottery, but your friends will never win.

                    Use this to make your own program, be creative! For example you could create a code that predicts that:
                    * your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
                    * your favorite movie will be chosen for movie night!
                    * you win tickets to your favorite show!
                    * you are the fairest of them all, like Snow White's magic mirror.
                    Let your imagination do the work!

                    Your program has to exist of at least 10 lines of code and need to have at least one `{if}` and `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends {is} Jordan, Lucy, Dave
                    {print} 'I can predict if you will win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person {is} {ask} 'Who are you?'
                    good_answer {is} Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
                    bad_answer {is} Bad luck! Try again!, Another person will win, You lose!
                    {if} person {in} friends
                    {print} bad_answer {at} {random}
                    {else}
                    {print} good_answer {at} {random}

                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age

                story_text: |
                    In this level you'll learn how to use **functions**. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.
                    To create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.
                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables `chosen_limb` and `chosen_color`.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} next_turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {print} 'Lets play a game of Twister!'
                    {repeat} _
                        call next_turn
                        {sleep} 2
                    ```
            15:
                story_text: |
                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument 'place' is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use 'place' we have placed `place` after `{define} song`.
                    When the function is called, the computer will replace the argument 'place', with the piece of text after ` song {with}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    ```not_hedy_code
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead
                    ```

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {def} song(place):
                        {print} ('My Bonnie is over the ', place)

                    song('ocean')
                    song('sea')
                    song('ocean')
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {def} calculate_new_price(amount, percentage):
                        percentage = percentage / 100

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but if not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and ask the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} How did I get here?
                    {print} I remember my friend telling me to go into the old mansion...
                    {print} and suddenly everything went black.
                    {print} But how did I end up on the floor...?
                    {print} My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
                    {print} What's that sound?
                    {print} Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
                    {print} I need to get out of here!
                    {print} There are 3 doors in front of me..
                    {ask} Which door should i pick?
                    {echo} I choose door
                    {print} ...?

                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you find the 4 missing words to complete the code?

                    * Ask for their name and repeat it back
                    * Ask for their date of birth and repeat it back
                    * Ask on which department they have their appointment
                    * Ask with which doctor they have their appointment
                    * Thank the patient for succesfully registering
                    * Tell the patient to take a seat in the waiting room

                    There is a problem in the nurses' office. All the nurses are complaining that the shedule for the night shifts is unfair. Some nurses have to work 2 night shifts a week, while others work none at all.
                    Can you help our nurses by creating a program that makes a fair night shift schedule?
                    ### Exercise
                    The program should:
                    * Show which nurse has to work the night shift on which day of the week.
                    * Make sure that each nurse has to work only one night shift a week.
                    The nurses names are: Meredith, Miranda, Alex, Derek, Christina, Izzy, George

                    Our nurses have a lot of tasks to accomplish in one day. One of these tasks is going around all the patients in the morning and ask them what they would like to have for breakfast.
                    Can you lessen the workload of our nurses by creating a program in which the patients choose their breakfast and send their order directly to the kitchenstaff?
                    ### Exercise
                    The program has to:
                    * Ask the patient to enter their name and roomnumber
                    * Greet the patient by their name
                    * Display all the food (sandwiches, cereal, fruit etc.) and drinks on the menu
                    * Ask the patient what they would like to eat
                    * Ask them what they would like to drink
                    * Repeat the order back to the patient
                    * Thank the patient for ordering
                    * Tell them that their order will be brought to their roomnumber in 15 minutes.

                    Our centre for burnwounds would like to lessen the workload by using an online triage tool. This way the patients can not only register their name and date of birth, but also what kind of burnwound they have (first, second or third degree) and advise on what to do next.
                    Can you help them?
                    ### Exercise
                    The program should:
                    * Start with a greeting and simple registration of the patients name and date of birth
                    * Preform a triage. Is the skin only red: first degree burn. Are there blisters: second degree burn. Is the skin gone/blackened/whitened from the burn: third degree burn.
                    * Give the patient the appropriate advise. First degree: Cool the burn with water and apply some cream on it. You do not need to see a doctor. Second degree: The doctor will see you and prescribe a special cream. Please wait in the waiting area. Third degree: Please go the the service desk now. You will need urgent care a.s.a.p.

                    Our midwifes get a lot of questions from pregnant ladies about what they can and can't eat while pregnant. Can you help their patients by creating an app that tells them if food is safe or not?
                    ### Exercise
                    Program should:
                    * Ask the patient what they would like to eat.
                    * Checks if it is in the list with 'unsafe food'
                    * If it is in the list with unsafe food, it tells the patient it is unsafe to eat.
                    * If it is not on the list, it tells the patient that it is probably safe to eat.
                    * Then the app also warns the person to always use common sense because the list might not be 100% complete. And it advises the person to always avoid raw meats, fish and eggs and alcohol.
                    When you are pregnant it is unsafe to eat: sushi, shrimp, tuna, blue cheese, tiramisu, runny eggs, carpaccio, rare steak, tartar

                    Our nurses keep track of the fluid balance of our patients. The fluid balance is how much fluid the patient has gained today (by drinking, eating or IV) minus how much fluid the person lost today (by peeing or vomiting).
                    The fluid balance needs to stay positive. If the fluid balance is negative the nurse needs to administer more IV fluid.
                    Can you help our nurses by making a tool they coudl use to calculate their patients fluid balance?
                    ### Exercise
                    The program should:
                    * Ask how much fluid the patient gained from drinking that day.
                    * Ask how much fluid the patient gained from eating that day.
                    * Ask how much fluid the patient gained from their IV that day.
                    * Ask how much fluid the patient lost from peeing that day.
                    * Ask how much fluid the patient lost from vomiting that day.
                    * Calculate the patients fluid balance and display it to the nurse.
                    * Tell the nurse to check whether the balance is positive or negative to decide if the patient needs more IV fluid today or not.

                    The staff at our emergency room has a problem. They say that there are a lot of patients coming in who don't really have an emergency and who should actually go to their gp.
                    These people are filling up the waiting room and putting a lot of workload on our staff. Will you help the emergency room staff by making a triage app that tells the patient if they have to go to the emergency room or not?
                    ### Exercise
                    Your program should tell the patient if they should 'go to the emergency room a.s.a.p.', 'call your healthcare provider to discuss your situation' or 'go to your own gp at earliest convenience'.
                    The programm will ask these questions:
                    * Is your situation life-threatening?
                    * Do you experience trouble breathing?
                    * Are you suddenly not able to speak, see, walk, or move?
                    * Did you ingest or inhale poison?
                    * Did you break a bone?
                    * Do you have a serious allergic reaction?
                    * Are you in severe pain?
                    If the patient answers 'yes' to any of these questions, the program will tell them to go to the emergency room a.s.a.p.. It will not ask any other questions, because time is of the essence.
                    If the patient answers 'no' to all the questions the program will ask:
                    * Can it wait till tomorrow?
                    If the answer is 'yes' the program will tell the patient to go to the gp at their earliest convenience. If the answer is 'no' the program will advise to call their healthcare provider to discuss the situation.

                    The program should:
                    * Have a list of names from patients with an appointment
                    * Ask the nurse if there are any new patients today and if so how many.
                    * Add the names of the new patients to the list as well
                    * Then the program should call on a patient to go to the vaccination area.
                    * The program should wait 10 seconds, clear the screen and call on the next patient, until every patient on the list has been called on.

                    After surgery our patients can sometimes experience a lot of pain. In those cases our patients can be given a morphine pump. They can administer some morphine themselves if they are in pain.
                    These pumps need to be programmed very carefully, so that the patients don't give themselves too much morphine. Can you program a morphine pump for us?
                    ### Exercise
                    The program should:
                    * Ask the nurse how many milliliters of morphine the patient has already had today.
                    * Tell the nurse to give the device to the patient
                    * Ask the patient how much pain they are experiencing on a scale of to 10.
                    * Tell the patient to press the x button if they would like some more morphine.
                    * Call the function start_pump with arguments pain_level and morphine_level if x is pressed.
                    * The function should print 'You will be administered 20 more ml of morphine' while the patients pain level is higher than or equal to 6 and the morphine level is lower than 120.
                    * After administering new morphine the program should sleep for 2 minutes (while testing your program you can use 2 seconds).
                    * After those 2 minutes, the morphine level should be updated (+20ml) and the pain level should be updated by asking the patient how they are feeling now.
                    * If the morphine level is too high or the patient is no longer in pain, the program should tell the patients that they won't be getting more morphine. If they are in a lot of pain, tell them to call the nurse.
                    * Tell the patient that the pump will be shut down now, and to press x if they need the pump to start again.

                    Can you help them by creating a game that allows them to practise the medical terms?
                    These are the terms that the students need to know: corpus = body, caput = head, ocolus = eye, nasus = nose, auris = ear, os = mouth, collum = neck, manus = hand, pectus = chest, humerus = shoulder, venter = stomach, tergum = back
                    ### Exercise
                    The program should:
                    * Be a game that allows the students to practise the medical terms.
                    * Give the students a point and a compliment when they have got the right answer.
                    * Take away a point and tell them the answer is incorrect when they have got the answer wrong.
                    * Also show the students the correct answer for a couple of seconds if they have given the wrong answer, wipe the answer off the screen again and keep asking the question until they have got it right.
                    * Keep playing until the student has answered all the questions correctly.
                    * Show the final score to the student.
                    * Give the student feedback based on their score: 12 points: Amazing!, 8 - 11 points: Good job, keep practising!, 7 or less: You should study more!

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple arguments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with `{ask}` commands.

                            {print} ('Hopefully you can take a nice rest in you room.')
                        {print} ('Your room number is ', room_number)

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |

                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an `{else}` command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animal`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we used the variable in a `{print}` command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal on the blank. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the `{is}` command. Then use it with a `{print}` command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} _
                    {print} I like favorite_animal
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
            13:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`. Before we used `{greater} {than}` and `{less} {than}`, but most programming languages use symbols for this.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {input}('How old are you?')
                    {if} age > 12:
                        {print}('You are older than I am!')
                    ```
                    ```
                    age = {input}('How old are you?')
                    {if} age < 12:
                        {print}('You are younger than me!')
                    {else}:
                        {print}('You are older than me!')
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {input}('What is your name?')
                    {if} name == 'Hedy':
                        {print}('You are cool!')
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {input}('What is your name?')
                    {if} name != 'Hedy':
                        {print}('You are not Hedy')

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    You don't always have to use the `{play}` command to play a whole song, sometimes you just want to play one note.
                    For example, if you want to make a quiz, you can play a happy high note if the answer is right and a sad low note if the answer is wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the first question by adding a line of code that plays a C3 note if the wrong answer is given.
                    Then think of 3 more questions to add to this quiz.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise
                    First create a sad note, then create at least 2 other tunes for different moods.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    mood {is} {ask} 'How are you feeling today?'

                    In this exercise you will see a pink blank space. You have to fill something in the place of the blank space before the code can be run.

                    Fill in the `{print}` command in the blank space and then add five more lines of code. Each line has to start with a `{print}` command.

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                    Make sure to use double quotes when you're using an apostrophe in you line!

                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code.
                    The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']
                    {print} friends[1] ' is the first friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[2] ' is the second friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[3] ' is the third friend on the list.'
                    #now we will match 2 lists using the variable i
                    lucky_numbers = [15, 18, 6]
                    {for} i {in} {range} (1, 3)
                        {print} friends[i] 's lucky number is ' lucky_numbers[i]

                    ### Exercise
                    Play around with the `{repeat}` command. Can you make the happy birthday song in only 3 lines of code instead of 4 now?
                example_code: |

                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 `{repeat}` command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you want to create a block of just one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an `{if}` or `{repeat}` command.
                    But you can't yet combine the two...

                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an `{if}` inside an `{if}`, `{repeat}` inside a `{repeat}` command and in each other.
                    Give it a try!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes
                    {repeat} 2 {times} {print} 'You knew that already!'
                    {else}
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'You have learned something new!'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can do with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                story_text: |
                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'
                    _ {repeat} 2 {times}
                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    Copy the example code into your input screen by clicking the yellow button.
                    Firstly, fill in the correct command on the blanks to make to code work properly.
                    Then add at least 4 more lines of code to the restaurant program.
                    Ask the customer what they would like to drink and ask if they want to pay with cash or card.
                    Lastly, think of a nice way to say goodbye to your customer.

                    In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only `{echo}` the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                    Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the toppings!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome to Hedy's restaurant!

                    food {is} {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {print} Great choice! The food is my favorite!
                    topping {is} {ask} Would you like meat or veggies on that?
                    {print} food with topping is on its way!
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy your own restaurant code from to previous level to the input screen below.
                    Fix the code by replacing the `{ask}` and `{echo}` commands and using variables, like you've learned in this level.

                    Now that your code is working again, it's time to add something more.
                    Look at the last line of the example code: `{print} food with topping is on its way!`
                    In this single line 2 variables have been used to create a summary of the order.
                    Now add your own summary of the food and drinks ordered by the customer.

                    **Extra** Now that you've learned how to use variables, you can use as many variables in one line as you'd like. Can you add more variables to your code, like eat in or take-away, cash or card, with or without a straw etc.?

                    In the restaurant you have to use quotation marks too when using the `{print}` or `{ask}` command.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the quotation marks to this code to make it work! Be careful: variables should not be in quotation marks.
                    Then, use the `{clear}` command to only show one line at a time in your output screen.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your restaurant code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots and add some `{clear}` commands.

                    Copy your own restaurant code from the previous levels. Create a problem in your restaurant and code it, like the example code did.
                    For instance, you could also run out of a menu item, or you don't take credit cards, or the ice cream machine is broken.

                    **Extra** Have you programmed the problem and programmed appropriate responses? Then try to add more `{if}` and `{else}` commands into your code.
                    Try to add an `{if}` after every `{ask}` command in your code to make the code as interactive as possible!

                    ### Exercise
                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - ask how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you complete the code? Hedy needs to repeat this question as many times as there are people. So if there are 5 people, the question needs to be asked 5 times.

                    This code can be expanded with more items on the menu, for example offering drinks, and/or multiple courses or desserts. Add at least one more item.
                    **Extra** Add even more items, as many options as you like!

                    In this level you will learn new commands to extend your code even further.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Place a `{and}` and a `{or}` in the logical place in the program.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Expand your restaurant with at least one more `{and}` and one `{or}`.
                    For example, create a special discount coupon that only applies to pizza, or give your customer a free drink
                    with fries and pancakes. Or something completely different of course!

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

                    Tip: Use the read aloud function to let Hedy sing the song to you!

                    ### Exercise
                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 7 as many times as you want by copying the lines.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {sleep}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    This children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.
                    If you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the code, you can sing the whole song!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    number = 6
                    number = number - 1
                    {print} number ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'
                    {print} 'One fell off and bumped his head'
                    {print} 'Mama called the doctor and the doctor said'
                    {print} 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'
                    {sleep}
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    ### Exercise
                    You can print the song Baby Shark with a `{repeat}`? Finish the code by replacing the blanks?
                    **Extra** After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition!
                    Can you think of one more song and print it?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. But without the `{repeat}` command, you had to copy the verses many times.
                    In this level you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the right command on the blanks and indent the code correctly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    _ 99 {times}
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    With `{for}` you can print make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you make the baby shark code even shorter by using a `{for}` command? Finish the example code.
                example_code: "```\nfamily = baby, mammy, daddy, grandma, grandpa\n_ _ _ _ \n  {print} _\n```\n"

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Print the song Five little monkeys jumping on the bed. Look up the text if you don't remember.

                    **Extra** Print the song Old MacDonald had a farm, and make sure all animals make a different sound, using an `{if}`.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    monkeys = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, but did you know that you could combine them with `{ask}` commands as well?
                    In this example we have changed the 'My Bonnie' program and made it interactive. You are now asked where Bonnie is.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} song (place)
                        {print} 'My Bonnie is ' place

                    chosen_place = {ask} 'Where do you want Bonnie to be?'
                    synonym = {ask} 'What is another word for that?'

                    song(chosen_place)
                    song(synonym)
                    song (chosen_place)
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In this level, you can program a song like OldMacDonald even more quickly. You can connect the right animal to the right sound by simply putting them in the same place in the list.
                    The Drunken Sailor is also quickly made in this level. You only need 8 lines for the entire song, check it out!

                    ### Exercise
                    Complete the Old MacDonald song by setting the variable `animal` to `animals[i]` and `sound` to `sounds[i]`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = ['pig', 'dog', 'cow']
                    sounds = ['oink', 'woof', 'moo']
                    {for} i {in} {range} (1, 3)
                        animal = _
                        sound = _
                        {print} 'Old MacDonald had a farm'
                        {print} 'E I E I O!'
                        {print} 'and on that farm he had a ' animal
                        {print} 'E I E I O!'
                        {print} 'with a ' sound sound ' here'
                        {print} 'and a ' sound sound ' there'
                        {print} 'here a ' sound
                        {print} 'there a ' sound
                        {print} 'everywhere a ' sound sound
                    ```

                    ```
                    lines = ['what shall we do with the drunken sailor', 'shave his belly with a rusty razor', 'put him in a long boat till hes sober']
                    {for} line {in} lines
                        {for} i {in} {range} (1, 3)
                            {print} line
                        {print} 'early in the morning'
                        {for} i {in} {range} (1, 3)
                            {print} 'way hay and up she rises'
                        {print} 'early in the morning'
                    ```

                    Now that we are using Python syntax, the songs you've coded before will need Python syntax too!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Now also look up your Old MacDonald song from before and correct it.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    lines = ['what shall we do with the drunken sailor', 'shave his belly with a rusty razor', 'put him in a long boat till hes sober']
                    {for} line {in} lines _
                        {for} i {in} {range} (1, 3) _
                            {print} _ line _
                        {print} 'early in the morning'

                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.

                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 100

                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 degrees to turn a quarter, 180 to turn half, and a full circle is 360 degrees.

                    ### Exercise
                    This code now creates the letter T. Can you change it to make the letter B?

                    **Extra** Change the letter into a different letter, like the first one of your name.
                    You can also make multiple letters, by setting the color to `{color}` `{white}` in between.

                example_code: |

                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list.
                    ### Exercise

                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **Extra** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.

                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                    **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {turn} 90

                    We can use functions to draw more complex figures with less code.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill the function so that three squares are created. If you want the image to look nicer, you can make the lines between the squares white.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    The code can be made even shorter. Place the final lines into a `{repeat}` so the figure remains the same.

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Create your own drawing with different figures.
                    Change both the number of figures with the `{repeat}` and the shape of the figures in the `{define}`

                    A star is usually drawn using 144-degree-turns. If you change this slightly to 143 degrees for example and repeat the pattern multiple times with a {while} loop you can make this figure.

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!
