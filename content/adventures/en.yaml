                    ## Welcome to Hedy!
                    In Level 1 you can use the commands `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}`.
                    Type your code in the programming field. Or press the green button in the example code block, and the code will be typed for you!
                    Try the code yourself with the green 'Run code' button under the programming field.

                    You can print text to the screen using the `{print}` command.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!
                    {print} Welcome to Hedy!
                    ```

                story_text_2: |
                    You can also ask for input with `{ask}` and repeat it back with an `{echo}` command.

                story_text_3: |
                    Let's get started! Don't know what to create? In the next tabs you will find ideas for programs to build.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {ask} What is your name?
                    {echo} hello
                    ```

                start_code: "{print} hello world!"
            2:
                story_text: |
                    ## Variables
                    In level 2 we learn two new commands: `{is}` and `{sleep}`.
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a variable. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:

                    This way you no longer need the `{echo}` command!

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    `{print}` still works the same, but the `{ask}` command has changed. You need to use a variable in the `{ask}` command as well. It looks like this:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} What is your name?
                    {print} Hello answer
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    Another new command in this level is `{sleep}`, which pauses your program for a second. If you type a number behind the {sleep} command, the program pauses for that amount of seconds.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} My favorite colour is...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} green!
                    ```
                start_code: "{print} hello world!"
            3:
                story_text: |
                    ## Make a list!
                    In level 3 you can make a list. You can let the computer choose something random from the list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

                example_code: |

                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    {print} animals {at} {random}
                    ```

                story_text_2: You can also add items to the list with `{add}` and remove items with `{remove}`.

                example_code_2: |

                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    {add} penguin {to_list} animals
                    {remove} cat {from} animals
                    {print} animals {at} {random}
                    ```

                start_code: "{print} hello world!"
            4:
                start_code: "{print} 'Hello world'"
                story_text: |
                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.

                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.

                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.

                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'
                    {print} 'We need to use ' answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Adventures are getting more and more difficult
                    The adventures are now getting more and more difficult in the successive tabs.
                    So it is best to start on the left with the story, and work to the right, in order to be challenged more and more.

                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'cool!' {else} {print} 'meh'
                story_text: |
                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    ## Lists
                    When we want to check if something is in a list, we can now use the `{in}` command.
                    This code prints pretty! if you choose green or yellow, and meh otherwise.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    pretty_colors {is} green, yellow
                    color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'
                    {if} color {in} pretty_colors {print} 'pretty!'
                    {else} {print} 'meh'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice'
                    {else} {print} 'boo!'
                    ```
            6:
                start_code: "{print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5"
                story_text: |
                    ## 1 + 1
                     In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                     The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                     The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                     That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} '5 plus 5 is ' 5 + 5
                    {print} '5 minus 5 is ' 5 - 5
                    {print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
            7:
                start_code: "{repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'Hedy is fun!'"
                story_text: |
                    ## Level 7! Level 7!
                    Level 7 adds the `{repeat}` command.  `{repeat}` can be used to execute one line of code multiple times.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'Hedy is fun!'
                    ```
            8:
                start_code: |-
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello folks'
                        {print} 'This will be printed 5 times'
                story_text: |
                    ## Indentation
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work as you know them. But `{if}` and `{repeat}` have changed!
                    You can now execute groups of code together, but you will have to *indent* the code.
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'
                    ```
            9:
                start_code: |-
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        food = {ask} 'What do you want?'
                        {if} food {is} pizza
                            {print} 'nice!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'pizza is better'
                story_text: |
                    ## All together now!
                    In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` and `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!
                    In the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.
                    Give it a try!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        food = {ask} 'What do you want?'
                        {if} food {is} pizza
                            {print} 'nice!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'pizza is better'
                    ```
            10:
                start_code: |-
                    animals {is} dog, cat, blobfish
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                      {print} 'I love ' animal
                story_text: |-
                    ## For each item in my list...
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, blobfish
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                      {print} 'I love ' animal
                    ```
            11:
                start_code: |-
                    {for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 5
                        {print} counter
                story_text: |-
                    ## Loops!
                    `{print}` works just the same but we add a new form of the `{for}`. You can now write `{for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 5` and use `counter` in your program.
                    Try it out to see what happens! Remember to use indentations after the `{for}` and `{if}` statements (That means starting a sentence with four spaces)
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 5
                        {print} counter
                    ```
            12:
                start_code: |-
                    {print} 'decimal numbers now need to use a dot'
                    {print} 2.5 + 2.5
                story_text: |-
                    ## Numbers and texts
                    **Decimal numbers**
                    So far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Two and a half plus two and a half is...'
                    {print} 2.5 + 2.5
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    **All texts need to be in quotation marks**
                    For this level on you will also have to use quotation marks when storing a text with `=`:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = 'Hedy the Robot'
                    {print} 'Hello ' name
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Iron Man'.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    superheroes = 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Iron Man'
                    {print} superheroes {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_4: |
                    **All text after `{if}` comparisons need quotation marks too**
                example_code_4: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name = 'Hedy the Robot'
                        {print} 'Hi there!'
                    ```
                story_text_5: |
                    **Numbers don't need quotation marks**
                    For numbers, you do not use quotation marks in the `=`:
                example_code_5: |
                    ```
                    score = 25
                    {print} 'You got ' score
                    ```
                story_text_6: |-
                    **Maths with words** 
                    In this level it is also allowed to use the + sign with texts. For example:
                example_code_6: |
                    ```
                    a = 'Hello '
                    b = 'world!'
                    {print} a + b
                    ```
            13:

                    ## And... Or..?
                    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two {if}'s but can use `{and}` and `{or}`. If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

                    ## Great, Greater, Greatest!
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example `age < 12` checks if `age` {is} smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example `age <= 11`.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example `points > 10` checks if `points` is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example `points >= 11`.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'

                    ## More loops!
                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!

                    ## More and more like real code!
                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    You can use the square brackets as well to point out a place in the lists.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']

                    ## Elif
                    Now we are going to change a little bit with indentation. Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.

                    In this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is short for {else} {if} and you need it when you want to make 3 (or more!) options.
                    Check it out!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ## The last level!
                    We arrived at real Python code! That means we need to use parentheses with {print} and {range} from now on.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('my name is Hedy!')

                    ## Make a story
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    As the first line, use this code:

                    ```
                    {ask} who is the star in your story?
                    ```

                    After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                example_code: |


                    ```
                    {ask} The main character of this story is
                    {print} The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    {echo} He's a bit scared,
                    {print} He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    {print} He's afraid this is a haunted forest

                    ## Story
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can use randomness for any monster, animal or other obstacle, like this:

                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story.

                    {print} He hears a sound

                    You can solve that in this level. You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```

                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.

                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'

                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'

                        {print} '💥ZAP!💥'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```

                    The example above is pretty straightforward, but by nesting {if} you can really elaborate your code and turn your story into a real game. Check out this example!

                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game {is} 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword {is} 'lost'` so the player can't continu the game until they have found something.

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.
                start_code: "{print} 'Baby shark'"

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    ## Songs
                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {repeat} 99 {times}

                    You can also make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!
                    Or you can make Old McDonald with all the different animals.

                    ## Let's draw
                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.
                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`

                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?

                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} {right}
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} {left}
                    {forward} 50

                    ## Colors
                    You can also change the color of the lines with the command `{color}`. Check out the example.
                    You can also use the command `{color} {white}` to make 'invisible' lines. You could use these white lines to move the turtle anywhere in the screen before you start drawing.

                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {color} {white}

                    {color} {yellow}
                    {forward} 50
                    {color} {red}
                    {forward} 50

                    ## Turtle
                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?

                    ## Searching turtle
                    In this level you can use use `{at} {random}` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list. You can copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path.

                    ## Let's draw
                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                example_code: |

                    ```
                    angles = {ask} 'How many angles do you want?'

                    ## Let's draw
                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.

                    ## Dishwashing
                    Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?
                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in this level!
                    You first make a list of the members of your family. Then choose '{at} {random}' from the list.
                example_code: |

                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!

                    ## Dishwashing
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Make it fair
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?

                    In this level we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.
                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    You can also make a die again in this level using the `{if}`.
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something {else}.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    choices {is} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm

                    {if} _ {is} earthworm {print} 'You can stop throwing.' _ {print} 'You have to hear it again!'

                    ## Dice
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in this, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm points = points + 5 {else} points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code_2: |
                    ## Looking forward

                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    You can also make a die again in level 5. With the `{repeat}` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.
                    Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                    But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!

                    Does your costumer have any allergies or do they dislike certain dishes? Then you can use the `{remove}`command to remove it from your menu.

                example_code_2: |

                    In thsi level you have to use quotation marks when using the `{print}` command.
                    Can you make your code from the previous levels work in this level too by adding the quotation marks?

                    Be careful! In the previous levels apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in this level Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                    So instead of typing  `{print} Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `{print} 'Today we are serving pizza'`
                example_code: |

                    In this level the {if} command allows you to {ask} your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
                    In the example below, you see that you can {ask} the customer {if} they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.

                    In this level you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.

                example_code: |
                    You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'
                    {print} 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10
                    {if} main {is} lasagne price = 12
                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = 8
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' main
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                    ## Challenge
                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - {ask} how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?
                    - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                    - add a children's menu?
                    - think of other fun things to add?
                example_code_2: |
                    In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Challenge
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?
                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |

                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Challenges
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    This level has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    question {is} {ask} 'What do you want to know?'

                    In thsi level you'll learn to (secretly) tip the odds in your favor, when using the fortune teller!
                    By using `{if}` and `{else}` you can make sure that you will always get a good fotune, while other people might not.
                    Check out this example to find out how.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict {if} youll win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person {is} {ask} 'Who are you?'
                    {if} person {is} Hedy {print} 'You will definitely win!🤩' {else} {print} 'Bad luck! Someone {else} will win!😭'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Hack the program
                    Replace Hedy with your own name in the last line, and Hedy will always predict that you will win the lottery and others won't!
                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers every time you run the code.
                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict {if} you will win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person {is} {ask} 'Who are you?'
                    goodanswer {is} Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
                    badanswer {is} Bad luck! Try again!, Another person will win, You lose!
                    {if} person {is} Hedy {print} goodanswer {at} {random} {else} {print} badanswer {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    This concept can be used to make may different programs, just be creative! For example you could create a machine that predicts that your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
                    Or you could make  Snow White's magic mirror on the wall, to tell everyone you are the fairest of them all!
                    Let your imagination do the work!

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}
                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    ## Example Silly Fortune Teller
                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                    football = {ask} 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = {ask} 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    {print} 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use the `{repeat}` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'You can {ask} 3 questions!'
                    {repeat} 3 {times} question = {ask} 'What do you want to know?'
                    answer = yes, no, maybe
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'My crystal ball says... ' answer {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Challenge
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question_1` , `question_2` and `question_3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller {ask} 3 questions and also print them!

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but {if} not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and {ask} the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.

                    ## Haunted house game
                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Escape from the haunted house!
                    {print} There are 3 doors in front of you...
                    choice {is} {ask} Which door do you choose?
                    {print} You picked door ... choice
                    monsters {is} a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    {print} You see...
                    {sleep}
                    {print} monsters {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    This story is pretty straight {forward}, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

                    ## Change the game into a tv gameshow!
                    Lastly, we'd like to challenge you to change this game into a gameshow (like the ones on tv) where you choose a door or suitcase and it contains a big price!
                    Can you do it?

                    ## Haunted House
                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.
                example_code: |

                    ```
                    {print} 'Escape from the haunted house!'

                    monsters {is} werewolf, mummy, vampire, zombie
                    chosen_door {is} {ask} 'Which door do you choose?'
                    {print} 'You chose door...' chosen_door

                    In this level you can use nesting, which allows you to make the haunted house even more interactive!

                    ## Challenge
                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door and 2 wrong ones?

                    ## Create a game of Blackjack
                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    Have fun!

                    In this level you can improve your Tic Tac Toe game with the {while} loop. With this loop you can combine the `{if} game != 'over'` and the `{for} i {in} {range} 1 to 9` into one simple line.

                    ## Tic Tac Toe
                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                    ## What's next?
                    Congratulations! You've reached the end of level 1. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes, but Hedy has a lot more to discover. 

                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time. 
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could {echo} what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want 
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want 
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    If the player types a hamburger and coke, you can't say `so you would like a hamburger and coke`, but you have to make two separate line. 
                    Also, the `{echo}` command only echoes the word at the end of the sentence. So you can't say `your hamburger is coming right up!`.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    Besides, you'll learn how to work with the `{at} {random}` command, that you can use to make games. 
                    So let's go to the next level!

                start_code: "{print} Let's go!"

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've learned what a variable is and how you can use it to make your adventures more interactive.
                    But... that's not the only thing you can do with variables! You can also use variables to make lists.
                    And you can even let Hedy pick a random word out of a list, which allows you to make real games!
                    Take a quick look at the next level!

                    In this level you've been practising with variables, but maybe you've come across this mistake.

                    Try to run this code:
                    ```
                    name {is} Sophie
                    {print} My name is name
                    ```
                    Of course you wanted to print `My name is Sophie` but Hedy prints `My Sophie is Sophie`.
                    In the next level this problem is fixed by using quotation marks.

                start_code: "{print} Let's go to the next level!"

                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you've already learned to use `{at} {random}` which made your games different every time you ran the code.
                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game.

                    In the next level you'll learn the `{if}` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example.
                    So let's take a peak!

                    ```
                    password {is} {ask} 'What is the correct password?'
                    ```
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've reached the end of this level, so you have learned `{ask}` and `{if}`. For example you can {ask} guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    The next level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in the next level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
                    Go see for yourself in the next level!
                example_code: |
                    ## Free drinks!
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome at McHedy'
                    order {is} {ask} 'What would you like to eat?'
                    {print} 'You would like ' order
                    {if} order {is} hamburger price {is} 5
                    {if} order {is} fries price {is} 2
                    drinks {is} {ask} 'What would you like to drink?'
                    {print} 'You would like ' drinks
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars for your ' order ' please'
                    {print} 'The drinks are free in this level because Hedy cant calculate the price yet...'
                    ```
                start_code: "{print} 'On to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                     Great job! You've reached the end of this level, which means you have practiced with `{if}` and `{else}`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
                     For example {if} you want to program 'Happy Birthday'.

                    That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily in the next level has a solution with the `{repeat}` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.
                example_code: |
                     ```
                     {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                     {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                     {print} 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
                     {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                     ```
                start_code: "{print} 'On to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
                    the next level allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'In the next level you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'
                    ```

                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"
            8:
                story_text: |
                    ## What's next?
                    Great job! You've reached the end of another level! In this level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In the next level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer = {ask} 'Would you like to go to the next level?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes
                        {print} 'Great! You can use the {repeat} commando in the {if} command!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Okay, you can stay here for a little longer!'
                    ```
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    You're doing great! In this level we still face a small problem. You have learned to repeat lines, but what if you'd want to slightly change the line.
                    For example if you want to sing the song '{if} you're happy and you know it'. It would look like this:

                    If you'd also want the next verse 'stomp your feet', and the next one, and the next one, you'd have to change the code completely.
                    In the next level you'll learn the `{for}` command, which allows you to make a list of actions and repeat the code with another action each time!
                    Please take a look!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times}
                        {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'
                    {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    ```

                    You have reached the end of this level, you're doing great! You are about to go to the next level. In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python.
                    In Python there is no `{repeat}` command, but there is a command that works like {repeat}. Are you curious to find out how to say `{repeat}` in Python language? Quickly go on to find out!
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"
            11:

                    ## What's next?
                    Maybe you have tried using decimal numbers in your restaurant adventure. If you did, you probably noticed that Hedy didn't understand them yet and always rounded off.
                    From the next level on you can use decimal numbers.

                    Another cool feauture in the next level is that you can use mulitiple words in a variable.
                    For intance, you could already do this...
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'Who is your favorite cartoon character?'
                    {print} 'I love watching ' name
                    ```
                    But you couldn't use multiple words in a variable like the example below. This program does not work yet in this level!
                    ```
                    show = SpongeBob SquarePants
                    {print} show 'is my favorite show!'
                    ```
                    Go to the next level to make this code work!
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you learned how to put two `{if}`commands inside each other. This works fine, but it does give you very long and unhandy codes like this one:

                    In this system you have to give both the correct username and the correct password.
                    In the next level you will learn the `{and}` command that will make this code a ot shorter and more understandable!
                    Check it out!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    username {is} {ask} 'What is your username?'
                    password {is} {ask} 'What is your password?'
                    {if} username {is} 'Hedy'
                        {if} password {is} 'secret'
                            {print} 'Welcome Hedy!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Access denied'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Access denied!'

                    With the program below you can calulate {if} you've passed a subject at school (so, a grade of six or higher).
                    You can see this code is extremely inefficient, du to the very long code in line 5.
                    All the different grades from 1 to 5 had to be programmed seperately. Lucky for you, in the next level you'll learn how to do this without this extremely long code!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    In this game below a code has been made to make sure the player can play on as long as he/she wants...
                    But the code is ineffective and way too long. Also, what {if} the player wants to play 101 games instead of 100?
                    You can't play to infinity?
                    In the next level you will learn a command that makes all of this a lot easier!

                    In the next level we will grow a bit more towards real Python code. thon code. You will also learn how to match two lists together.
                    This way you can program a code in which the correct animal is matched to the right sound.
                    Because the two codes below... Are obviously nonsense!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'

                    ```
                    You could also try to make it work this way, but....

                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'

                    In the next level it's time for a new command. You might have noticed in the previous levels that `{if}` and `{else}` sometimes aren't enough.
                    For example in this code:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'What is for dinner tonight?'
                    options = ['pizza', 'broccoli', 'green beans']
                    chosen = options {at} {random}
                    {if} chosen = 'pizza'
                        {print} 'Yummy! Pizza!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Yikes...'
                    ```
                story_text_2: In this code it would be great to have 2x an `{else}` so you could have one option for the broccoli and one for the green beans. The next level comes with the new command `{elif}` that makes this possible! So check out the next level now!
