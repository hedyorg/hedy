        levels:
            1:
                story_text: |
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    In the first line, use `{ask}` and ask who the main character of the story will be.

                    After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} The main character of this story is
                    {print} The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    {echo} They're a bit scared,
                    {print} They hear crazy noises everywhere
                    {print} They're afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now create your own story of at least 6 lines of code.
                    This story cannot be the same as the example code.
                    Use at least one `{ask}` and one `{echo}` command.
                    You can make it about any topic you like.
                    If you can't think of a topic, use one of our choices: going to the movies, a sports match or a day at the zoo.
            2:
                story_text: |
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} What is the name of the main character?
                    {print} name is now going to run in the woods
                    {print} name is a bit scared
                    {print} Suddenly she hears a crazy noise...
                    {sleep}
                    {print} name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a `{sleep}` command to your code to build up tension in your story.
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can use randomness for any monster, animal or other obstacle, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} ü¶î, üêø, ü¶â, ü¶á
                    {print} They now hear the sound of an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} They hear a sound
                    animals {is} üêø, ü¶î, ü¶á, ü¶â
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy your story from the previous levels into this level.
                    In this level you've learned 3 new commands `{at} {random}` , `{add} {to_list}` and `{remove} {from}`.
                    Add new lines of code to your story, so that all of the new commands are featured at least once in your story.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code and finish it by adding quotation marks on the blanks in lines 1 and 2.
                    The blanks in line 3 and 4 should not be replaced by quotation marks, but a `{sleep}` and a `{clear}` command. Can you make it work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your story code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                    Mind: The variables in your own story should be outside of the quotation marks. Just like the second line of the example code. In that line the variable name is placed outside of the quotation marks.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} _ What is your name? _
                    {print}  _ The main character is called _ name
                    _
                    _
                    {print} name  _ is now going to walk in the woods _
                    {print} name _ is a bit scared _
                    animals {is} ü¶î, üêø, ü¶â, ü¶á
                    {print} _ He hears the sound of a _ animals {at} {random}
                    {print} name _ is afraid this is a haunted forest _
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.
                    In the example code you can see how to make 2 different endings.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Write a new short story of at least 6 lines of code about a topic of your choosing.
                    No inspiration? Choose one of these topics: a superhero, a boring school day, stranded on a desert island.

                    Now give the player a change to choose a happy or a bad end, just like in the example code.
                    Program both the endings.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Copy the story you've created in your own story adventure in the previous levels.
                    Find a way to add at least 2 `{if}` and `{else}` commands to your story.
                    This can be with a happy or bad ending, but you can also try to find other ways to incoporate the commands.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name ' walks through the forest'
                    {print} name ' encounters a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name ' takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats ' name
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add repetition to your own story. Go back to your saved programs, choose your story program from a previous level and
                    find a line containing `{print}` and repeat it!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your `{if}` commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The example code shows two different endings; one where the characters jump in a time machine and one where they do not.
                    Complete the blanks with at least one sentence per ending.
                    **Extra** Make the story longer. What happens in the story? You can also add a second `{ask}` with different options.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your saved programs, choose your story program from level 5. Now write a good and a bad ending of at least three lines long each!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} _
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Oh no! Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} _
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: "In this level you can use `{if}` and `{repeat}` commands inside other `{if}` and `{repeat}` commands. \nThis gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.\n\n### Exercise 1\nFinish the code so the `{if}` works correctly.\n\n### Exercise 2\nAdd an `{if}` and `{else}` for the part of the story where Robin goes home too.\n\n### Exercise 3\nGo back to your level 8 story and use at least two `{if}`s inside another `{if}`.\n"
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                        _ {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        _ {else}
                        _ {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'Brown bear, Brown bear, what do you see'.

                    ### Exercise

                    Look at <a href="https://www.yonkerspublicschools.org/cms/lib/NY01814060/Centricity/Domain/1621/Brown%20Bear%20Book.pdf"> the story</a> if you do not know it, and make sure it is printed as in the book.
                example_code: "```\nanimals = _ , _ , _ \n{print} 'Brown bear, Brown bear'\n{print} 'What do you see?'\n```\n"
            13:
                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can make your stories more versatile. You can ask two questions and respond to the combination of answers.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Look at the example code and finish it. Then add at least 2 more `{if}` codes with `{and}` or `{or}`.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Find a story from a previous level, and add one `{and}` or `{or}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'
                    weapon = {ask} 'What weapon does she draw?'
                    {if} path {is} 'left' {and} weapon {is} 'sword'
                        _
                    ```
            15:
                story_text: |
                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continue the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise
                    The example code shows you how to use the `{while}` loop in a story. Now **think of your own scenario** in which the player has to find something before they can continue.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    {print} 'You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.'
                    {print} 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    {print} 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'
                    {while} keys == 'lost'
                        location = {ask} 'Where do you want to look?'
                        {if} location == 'flowerbed'
                            {print} 'Here they are!'
                            keys = 'found'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Nope they are not at the ' location
                    {print} 'Now you can enter the house!'
                    ```

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    naam = {input}("What's your name?")
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to_list} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    like {is} {ask} What is your favorite animal?

                    ## Remove from
                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    dislike {is} {ask} What animal do you not like?

                    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two `{if}`s but can use `{and}` and `{or}`.

                    If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

                    Now that you can use the `{print}` command, you are ready to learn the next command: `{ask}`. With the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question. Check it out:
                example_code: |

                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer back to you, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.
                    Check it out:

                    In the previous adventure you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous adventure and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.
                example_code_2: |

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.

                    ***Set the variables***
                    Start by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.

                    ***Create a function to calculate the points***
                    Create a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.
                    All the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.
                    Return the variable `points` at the end of the function.

                    ***Test the function***
                    Test if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.
                    Run the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results? Great! Then you can remove the testing part and move on the the next adventure!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'BLACKJACK'

                    # Set these variables
                    cards = _
                    face_cards = _
                    card_1 =

                    # Create a function to calculate the points
                    {define} calculate_points {with} card:
                        {if} card {in} face_cards:
                            points = _
                        {elif} _
                            _

                        _ points

                    # Test your function
                    {print} 'Your card is a ' _
                    {print} 'That is worth ' _ ' points'.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the second part of our Blackjack game.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure***
                    In the previous adventure you've started a list of variables and created a function to calculate how many points a card is worth. Copy your code and paste it here. Mind that you don't need the testing part, so if you haven't removed that yet, please do so now.

                    ***Add more variables***
                    You have already set the lists `cards` and `face_cards` and the variable `card_1`. Underneath those variables create 3 more variables: `card_2`, dealer_card_1` and `dealer_card_2`. These variables are all set to a random card from the list of cards.

                    ***Add up points***
                    To calculate how many points you have scored we call the function with card 1 and we do it again for card 2. Then we add both these scores together to get your total.
                    Do the same thing for the dealers points, but be sure to use the dealer's cards and not your own!

                    ***2 Aces***
                    You're doing great! Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.

                    ***Show the score***
                    Lastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is. Then show which cards the dealer has and how many points they have.

                    ***Continue in the next adventure***
                    Great! You have finished this part of the game! Copy your code and go to the next adventure to learn how to ask for an extra card and to declare a winner.
                example_code: |

                    card_2 = _
                    dealer_card_1 = _
                    dealer_card_2 = _

                    # Add up your points
                    your_points_1 = {call} _ {with} card_1
                    your_points_2 = _
                    your_total = _

                    # Add up the dealers points
                    dealer_points_1 = _
                    _

                    In the previous adventures you have learned how to draw 2 random cards for yourself and for the dealer and to calculate how many points you both got.
                    In this adventure we add the option to ask for an extra card for both you and the dealer.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Firstly, copy your code from the previous adventure and paste it here.

                    ***Extra card for you*** If you want, you can get an extra card to get your total as close to 21 as possible. First ask the player if they want an extra card.
                    If they do, pick a random card and print what they have drawn. If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.
                    In case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.
                    If your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.
                    If the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.
                    Lastly, print your new total of points.

                    ***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.
                    Copy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section. Then change it to fit the dealer picking an extra card and getting points added to their total.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    In the last 3 adventures you have almost created a working blackjack game! The only thing left to do is to decide a winner!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Start by pasting the code that you've made so far into your programming field.

                    ***Decide a winner***
                    Firstly, if you and the dealer have an equal amount of points, it's a draw.
                    Secondly, if the dealer has more than 21 points and you don't, you are the winner.
                    Thirdly, if both you and the dealer have less than 22 points, we have to see who came closest to 21. We do that by comparing who has the highest score. Is your total higher than the dealer's total, then you are the winner. If not, the dealer wins.
                    Lastly, in all other scenarios (e.g. you have more than 21 points and the dealer doesn't, or you both have more than 21 points) you are the loser.

                    ***Enjoy the game!***
                    Does your game work properly? Amazing! You have done a great job! Enjoy your game!
                    If it doesn't work right away, no worries, you might have made a mistake. Just keep calm and bebug your code using the ladybug button.

                    This calculator game helps you practise your tables of multiplication!
                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks. We want this program to ask the player these questions:
                    ```
                    How much is 1 times 1?
                    How much is 1 times 2?

                    With a `{for}` you can simplify tables of multiplication practise program.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    number = 10

                    In this level, you can make a calculator that works for decimal numbers.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill out the blanks to complete the calculator. Remember to use a period and not a comma for decimal numbers.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Create a new mathematics practice program, but now use decimal numbers.
                    Create a list of numbers, choose two to multiple and let the player answer.
                    And of course you have to validate the answer! **Extra** Increase the difficulty by adding lives: A player loses a life for a wrong answer and after three wrong answers the game ends.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    number1 = {ask} 'What is the first number?'

                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer1 = {ask} 'What is 10 times 7?'

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next adventure!**
                example_code: |

                    You can add the `{while}` loop to the calculator game you've learned to make in a previous level.
                    This makes sure the player can't continue to the next question if they answer incorrectly.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the `{while}` loop in the function, ask the player what number_1 times number_2 is and print their answer.
                    Then `{call}` the function.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous adventure.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.
                    Fix this program to turn it into the nursery rhyme 'Brother John (Fr√®re Jacques)' by using the {repeat} command of course!

                    Debug this calendar program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calendar
                    Here are all the days of November
                    November 1
                    November 2
                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    Welcome to Hedy! Here you can learn how to program step by step.

                    Try the code yourself! The yellow button copies the example code to your programming field.
                    Then push the green 'Run code' button under the programming field to run the code.

                    Ready? Then go to the next adventure to learn how to make your own codes!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello world!
                    ```
            2:
                story_text: |
                    Congratulations! You've reached level 2. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes!
                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time.
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    So let's go to the next adventure!
                example_code: |
                    **Warning! This code does not work!**
                    In Hedy commands will change sometimes. `{echo}` for example only works in level 1. In this level you'll learn a better way to echo answers back.
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want
                    ```
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In the previous level you've learned what a variable is and how you can use it to make your adventures more interactive.
                    But... that's not the only thing you can do with variables! You can also use variables to make lists.
                    And you can even let Hedy pick a random word out of a list, which allows you to make real games!
                    Take a quick look at the next adventure!
            4:
                story_text: |
                    In the previous levels you've been practising with variables, but you may have come across this problem.
                    You might have tried to run a code like this:

                    Of course you wanted to print

                    `My name is Sophie`

                    but Hedy prints

                    `My Sophie is Sophie`.

                    In this level this problem is fixed by using quotation marks.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Sophie
                    {print} My name is name
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In the previous levels you've already learned to use `{at} {random}` which made your games different every time you ran the code.
                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game.

                    In this level you'll learn the `{if}` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example.
                    So let's go to next adventure for the new command!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    password {is} {ask} 'What is the correct password?'
                    ```
            6:
                story_text: |
                    In the previous level you have practiced with `{ask}` and `{if}`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    This level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in this level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
                    Go see for yourself!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    food_price {is} 0
                    drink_price {is} 0
                    total_price {is} 0
                    {print} 'Welcome to McHedy'
                    order {is} {ask} 'What would you like to eat?'
                    {if} order {is} hamburger food_price {is} 5
                    {if} order {is} fries food_price {is} 2
                    drink {is} {ask} 'What would you like to drink?'
                    {if} drink {is} water drink_price {is} 0
                    {else} drink_price {is} 3
                    total_price {is} food_price + drink_price
                    {print} 'That will be ' total_price ' dollars, please'
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    Great job! You've reached the next level, which means you have practiced with `{if}` and `{else}`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
                    For example if you want to program 'Happy Birthday'.

                    That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily in the next adventure you'll learn a solution with the `{repeat}` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                    {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                    {print} 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
                    {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    Now you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
                    This level allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'In the next adventure you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ``` Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.

                    {if} answer {is} yes
                        {print} 'Great! You can learn to use the repeat command in the if command!'

            10:
                story_text: |
                    You're doing great! In the previous levels we still faced a small problem. You have learned to repeat lines, but what if you'd want to slightly change the line.
                    For example if you want to sing the song 'if you're happy and you know it'. It would look like this:

                    If you'd also want the next verse 'stomp your feet', and the next one, and the next one, you'd have to change the code completely.
                    In this level you'll learn the `{for}` command, which allows you to make a list of actions and repeat the code with another action each time!
                    Please take a look!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times}
                        {print} 'if youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    {print} 'if youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'
                    {print} 'if youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    ```
            11:
                story_text: |
                    You have reached level 11, you're doing great! In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python.
                    In Python there is no `{repeat}` command, but there is a command that works like {repeat}. Are you curious to find out how to say `{repeat}` in Python language? Quickly go on to find out!
            12:
                story_text: |
                    Maybe you have tried using decimal numbers in your restaurant adventure. If you did, you probably noticed that Hedy didn't understand them yet and always rounded off.
                    From this level on you can use decimal numbers.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    burger = 5
                    drink = 2
                    total = burger + drink
                    print 'You have ordered a burger and a drink'
                    print 'That costs ' total ' dollars please'

            13:
                story_text: |
                    In the previous levels you've learned how to put two `{if}`commands inside each other. This works fine, but it does give you very long and unhandy codes like this one:

                    In this system you have to give both the correct username and the correct password.
                    In this level you will learn the `{and}` command that will make this code a lot shorter and more understandable!
                    Check it out!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    username = {ask} 'What is your username?'
                    password = {ask} 'What is your password?'
                    {if} username {is} 'Hedy'
                        {if} password {is} 'secret'
                            {print} 'Welcome Hedy!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Access denied'

                    With the example code you can calculate if you've passed a subject at school (so, a grade of six or higher).
                    You can see this code is extremely inefficient, due to the very long code in line 5.
                    All the different grades from 1 to 5 had to be programmed separately. Lucky for you, in this level you'll learn how to do this without this extremely long code!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    first_grade = {ask} 'What score did you get on your first test?'
                    second_grade = {ask} 'What score did you get on your second test?'
                    added = first_grade + second_grade
                    mean_grade = added / 2
                    {if} mean_grade = 1 {or} mean_grade = 2 {or} mean_grade = 3 {or} mean_grade = 4 {or} mean_grade = 5
                        {print} 'Oh no! You have failed the subject...'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Great! You have passed the subject!'
                    ```

                    In this game below a code has been made to make sure the player can play on as long as they want...
                    But the code is ineffective and way too long. Also, what if the player wants to play 101 games instead of 100?
                    You can't play to infinity?
                    In this level you will learn a command that makes all of this a lot easier!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    game = 'on'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 100
                        {if} game == 'on'

                    In this level we will grow a bit more towards real Python code. You will also learn how to match two lists together.
                    This way you can program a code in which the correct animal is matched to the right sound.
                    Because the two codes below... Are obviously nonsense!
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'
                    sounds = 'cluck', 'neigh', 'moo'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'A ' animal ' says ' sounds {at} {random}
                    ```
                    You could also try to make it work this way, but....
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'
                    sounds = 'cluck', 'neigh', 'moo'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {for} sound {in} sounds
                            {print} 'A ' animal ' says ' sound
                    ```
                    Note: These codes will not work like this in this level. Head to the next adventure to see which parts you need to correct.

                    Now we are going to change indentation a little bit. Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.

                    In this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is short for ``{else} {if}`` and you need it when you want to make 3 (or more!) options.
                    Check it out!

                    Congratulations! You have reached the last level of Hedy! The code you have created here can be copied to real Python environments like replit or PyCharm, and you can continue learning there!
                    Note however that Python can only read English commands, so if you have been using other languages, you will need to switch to English now.

                    In this level we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.
                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    ![Die of earthworms with 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/felienne/hedy@24f19e9ac16c981517e7243120bc714912407eb5/coursedata/img/dobbelsteen.jpeg)

                    {print} You threw _ {at} {random} !

                    ### Exercise
                    The dice in the example above are dice for a specific game. Can you make normal dice?
                    Or other special dice from a different game?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                    In this level you can also create dice. But this time you can try it yourself, without an example code!

                    ### Exercise
                    Make your own dice in this level.
                    Tip: If you have no idea how to make dice. Take a peek at your dice from the previous level, but don't forget to add quotation marks.

                    We are going to add the `{if}` and `{else}` commands to our dice!

                    ### Exercise
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm. It should say "You have to throw again" if you've thrown anything else.
                    **Extra** Maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction, e.g. 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices {is} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw {is} choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you have thrown ' throw
                    _ throw {is} earthworm {print} 'You can stop throwing.'
                    _ {print} 'You have to throw it again!'
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in this, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to copy and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw ' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm points = points + 5 {else} points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are ' points ' points'
                    ```
                example_code_2: |
                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of copy and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                story_text: |
                    You can also make a dice again in this level. With the `{repeat}` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.

                    ### Exercise
                    Try to finish the sample code!  **Extra** Think of a game you know that involves a dice and program that using a `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

                    ### Exercise
                    In this level you can create a little game in which you'll have to throw 6 as fast as possible.
                    We have started the code, it's up to you to get the game to work!

                    Firstly, add a `{while}` loop that checks if 6 has been thrown or not.
                    As long as you haven't thrown 6 already, throw the dice on a random number.
                    Print what the player has thrown.
                    Add a try to the amount of tries
                    Wait a second before you throw again, or - in case you've thrown a 6 - before the game ends.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    options = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
                    {print} 'Throw 6 as fast as you can!'
                    thrown = 0
                    tries = 0
                    _
                    _
                    _
                    _
                    _
                    {print} 'Yes! You have thrown 6 in ' tries ' tries.'

                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in this level!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie

                    ### Exercise
                    Make your own version of the dishwasher program. Firstly make a list of your family members.
                    Then think of a task that needs to be done, and let the computer decide who has to do the task with the `{at} {random}` command.

                    **Extra** Don't feel like doing the dishes yourself? Hack the program by removing your name from the list with the `{remove}` `{from}` command.

                    With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing program even better.

                    ### Exercise
                    First, fill in right symbols or commands on the blanks to make this example program work.
                    Did you get it? Great! Now copy your own code from the previous level and make it work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {print} _ the dishes are done by _
                    {sleep}
                    {print} people {at} _

                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher {is} people {at} {random}
                    _ dishwasher {is} Sophie {print} _ too bad I have to do the dishes _
                    _ {print} 'luckily no dishes because ' _ ' is already washing up'
                    ```
            6:
                story_text: |
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?
                story_text_2: |
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to do the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again until everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and Tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And‚Ä¶ can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}

                    With the `{repeat}` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for multiple days!
                    ### Exercise
                    Use the `{repeat}` command to decide on who needs to wash the dishes for an entire week. Each blank needs to be filled with one command or number!
                    **Extra** Can you think of other tasks in the house? Adapt the code so it decides on three household chores. Do not forget to print what tasks it concerns!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.

                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                story_text: |
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her `{echo}` the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    _ Who are you?
                    _ Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    _ I see... I see...

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only `{echo}`.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} I‚Äôm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?

                    ### Exercise
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

                    We have removed all the quotation marks from this example code, can you add them in all the right places?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your fortune teller code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is your question:  question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}

                    In the example code you see how to make a fortune teller program that allows you to tip the odds in your favor. This cheating program always tells you that you will win the lottery, but your friends will never win.

                    Use this to make your own program, be creative! For example you could create a code that predicts that:
                    * your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
                    * your favorite movie will be chosen for movie night!
                    * you win tickets to your favorite show!
                    * you are the fairest of them all, like Snow White's magic mirror.
                    Let your imagination do the work!

                    Your program has to exist of at least 10 lines of code and need to have at least one `{if}` and `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends {is} Jordan, Lucy, Dave
                    {print} 'I can predict if you will win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person {is} {ask} 'Who are you?'
                    good_answer {is} Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
                    bad_answer {is} Bad luck! Try again!, Another person will win, You lose!
                    {if} person {in} friends {print} good_answer {at} {random}
                    {else} {print} bad_answer {at} {random}

                    In this level you'll learn how to use **functions**. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.
                    To create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.
                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} _
                        {call} turn

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument 'place' is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use 'place' we have placed `{with} place` after `{define} song`.
                    When the function is called, the computer will replace the argument 'place', with the piece of text after `{call} song {with}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    ```not_hedy_code
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead
                    ```

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} song {with} place
                        {print} 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    {call} song {with} 'sea'
                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    ```

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        {return} amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _
                    {print} 'The new price is ' new_price ' dollar'
                    ```

                    Let's make functions the Pythons way! To define a function, we no longer use:

                    `{define} name_function {with} argument_1, argument_2:`

                    but we use:

                    `{def} name_function(argument_1, argument_2):`.


                    If you don't want to use arguments, you just leave the space between the parantheses empty.
                    To call a function, we don't need the `{call}` command anymore. You just type the name of the function.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    In this adventure we program a game of hangman. First we make some preparations, then we program the game and in the third part we add a drawing with the turtle.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Set the variables*** In this game of hangman, Player 1 chooses an answer and Player 2 has to guess the letters in this answer.
                    To let the computer know all the letters in the word, we will turn the answer into a list of letters. We also do this with the guesses Player 2 makes.
                    We will start the game with 2 empty lists. We have made an empty list for the variable answer for you. Now make an empty list for guessed_letters as well.
                    Then we fill in how many mistakes were made. At the start of the game, this should be 0.
                    The variable `amount_letters` tells us how many letters are in the answer. Ask Player 1 to tell us how many letters their word has.
                    Lastly we tell the computer if the game is over. We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.

                    ***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.
                    Then we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.

                    ***Player 2's turn***
                    Tell Player 2 its their turn. Then tell Player 2 how many letters there are in the answer. Finally, print the list of `guessed_letters`.

                    ***Go to the next adventure*** Now that all the starting variables are set, we can start programming the game itself. Check out the next tab to learn how!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'Hangman!'

                    # Set the variables
                    answer = []
                    guessed_letters = _
                    mistakes_made = _
                    amount_letters = {ask} _
                    _ = 'False'

                    # Choosing the answer
                    {for} _
                        letter = {ask} 'Player 1, what is letter ' i '?'
                        _
                        {add} '_' {to} _

                    # Player 2 turn
                    print _
                    print _
                    print guessed_letters

                    Now it's time to program the hangman game.

                    ### Exercise

                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous adventure and paste the code in the programming field.

                    ***The game*** This game continues playing until Player 2 is game over. Fill in the while command accordingly. Now, Player 2 is allowed to guess a letter, so ask Player 2 to guess a letter.
                    We need to check if their answer is correct, so check if their `guess` is (somewhere) in the (list) `answer`. Then we let the computer figure out which of the letter(s) is the guess. We have already programmed that part for you.
                    Next, we want to compliment the player for finding a correct letter and we want to print the list `guessed_letters`, so the player can see their progress.

                    The next part we're going to program is what happens when the player has guessed all of the letters. So, if their list of `guessed_letters` is the same as our list `answer`.
                    If the lists are the same, congratulate Player 2 with their victory and set the variable `game_over` to `True`.

                    Next, we'll program what happens when Player 2 guesses wrong (so the `{else}` command). First, tell the player that their guess was wrong. Then increase the `mistakes_made` variable by 1.

                    For the last part we'll program what happens when Player 2 has made 10 mistakes. We'll print that Player 1 has won the game. Then we'll print the correct answer. And finally, we'll set our `game_over` variable to `True`, so the game stops.

                    ***Go to the next adventure*** Amazing work! Your game is playable, but wouldn't it be fun if the hangman was actually drawn when Player 2 makes a mistake?

                                if answer[i] == guess:
                                    guessed_letters[i] = guess
                            {print} _
                            {if} guessed_letters == _:
                                {print} _
                                game_over = _

                    In a game of hangman the mistakes are shown by drawing a part of the hangman each time a mistake has been made.
                    We now add those drawings with our turtle!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Create a function that draws the hangman*** Create a function that draws the hangman in 10 steps. We have already made step 1 for you.

                    ***Test the function*** Test the function by calling the function with 10. If you are happy with the function, remove the line that calls the function for now. We will call the function when the player makes a mistake.

                    ***Paste your hangman game under your function*** Go back to the previous adventure and copy your hangman game. Paste the game underneath your function.

                    ***Call the function when the player makes a mistake*** Under the line `mistakes_made = mistakes_made + 1` we will call the function. We want the turtle to take the same amount of steps as the player has made mistakes, so we call the function with `mistakes_made` as argument.

                    ***Enjoy your game!***

                    {print} But a monster_2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.

                    In the example above the monsters are predetermined. So each time you run your code, the output is the same.
                    Can you add `{ask}` commands to make the haunted house interactive and have the players choose the monsters they come across?

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example codes and fill in the blanks to make it work!

                    **Extra** This story is pretty straight forward, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    _ _ _ Which door do you choose?
                    _ You picked door ... choice
                    monsters _ a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED

                    Can you make your Haunted House level 4 proof?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your haunted house code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple agruments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with {ask} commands.

                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.

                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an {else} command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy
                        {print} 'Welcome Hedy'
                        {print} 'You can play on your computer!'
                    ```

                    When we want to check if something is in a list, we can now use the `{in}` command.
                    This code prints pretty! if you choose green or yellow, and meh otherwise.

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animal`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we used the variable in a `{print}` command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal on the blank. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the `{is}` command. Then use it with a `{print}` command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} _
                    {print} I like favorite_animal
                    ```
            6:
                story_text: |
                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
            14:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age < 12
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'You are older than me!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'

                    In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    Type `{play}` followed by the note you want to play. The scale goes C-D-E-F-G-A-B.
                    As you can see there are 7 different letters, but we can play more than just 7 notes.
                    Type a number between 0 and 9 behind the letter to choose the scale, for example after B4 comes C5.
                    C0 is the lowest note you can play, B9 is the highest.

                    You don't always have to use the `{play}` command to play a whole song, sometimes you just want to play one note.
                    For example, if you want to make a quiz, you can play a happy high note if the answer is right and a sad low note if the answer is wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the first question by adding a line of code that plays a C3 note if the wrong answer is given.
                    Then think of 3 more questions to add to this quiz.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the song of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

                    With `{pressed}` you can use keys on your keyboard to control what lines are used.

                    ### Exercise
                    Look at the example and add one more line of code that reacts to a key press.
                example_code: |

                    The code you have seen in level 5 only checks the key once. Copy the example code and add a `{repeat}` to it, so that you can press the keys many times.
                    Use this code to draw something nice.

                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                    ```
                    name = 'Hedy the Robot'
                    {print} 'Hello ' name
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Black Widow'.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    superheroes = 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Black Widow'

                    ## At random
                    In this level you can make a list using the `{is}` command. You can let the computer choose a random item from that list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dogs, cats, kangaroos

                    Try out the `{at} {random}` command by making your own gameshow (like the ones on tv) where you choose a door or suitcase and it contains a big price!
                    Can you do it? We have already put the first lines into the example code.

                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code.
                    The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']
                    {print} friends[1] ' is the first friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[2] ' is the second friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[3] ' is the third friend on the list.'
                    #now we will match 2 lists using the variable i
                    lucky_numbers = [15, 18, 6]
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 3
                        {print} friends[i] 's lucky number is ' lucky_numbers[i]
                    ```
                story_text_2: |-
                    Now that you've learned to use the brackets in lists, you can also start using the {at} {random} command in the Python way!

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an `{if}` or `{repeat}` command. 
                    But you can't yet combine the two...

                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an `{if}` inside an `{if}`, `{repeat}` inside a `{repeat}` command and in eachother.
                    Give it a try!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes {repeat} 2 {times} {print} 'You knew that already!'
                    {else} {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'You have learned something new!'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can do with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'
                    _ {repeat} 2 {times}
                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    Now that your code is working again, it's time to add something more.
                    Look at the last line of the example code: `{print} food with topping is on its way!`
                    In this single line 2 variables have been used to create a summary of the order.
                    Now add your own summary of the food and drinks ordered by the customer.

                    **Extra** Now that you've learned how to use variables, you can use as many variables in one line as you'd like. Can you add more variables to your code, like eat in or take-away, cash or card, with or without a straw etc.?

                    Add the quotation marks to this code to make it work! Be careful: variables should not be in quotation marks.

                    In this level you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.
                    But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                    ### Exercise
                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - ask how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?
                    - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                    - add a children's menu?
                    - think of other fun things to add?
                example_code: |
                    You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Restaurant Chez Hedy'
                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'
                    {print} 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10
                    {if} main {is} lasagne price = 12
                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = 8
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' main
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'

                    In this level you've learned how to use the `{repeat}` command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to `{ask}` multiple people what they'd like to eat.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you complete the code? Hedy needs to repeat this question as many times as there are people. So if there are 5 people, the question needs to be asked 5 times.
                    **Extra** Expand your code with more questions, for example about drinks or sauce.

                    In this level you can make your virtual restaurant more elaborate by repeating multiple lines of code. Like this:

                    ### Exercise
                    This code can be expanded with more items on the menu, for example offering drinks, and/or multiple courses or desserts. Add at least one more item.
                    **Extra** Add even more items, as many options as you like!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Finish the code with an `{ask}` on the blanks such that the customer is asked what they want to eat for each course.
                example_code: "```\ncourses = appetizer, main course, dessert\n{for} course {in} courses\n    {print} 'What is your order for ' course '?'\n    _ \n    _\n```\n"

                    Of course, you could also order for multiple people!
                    Can you add the correct amount of indentation before each line to make the code work properly?
                    Tip: some lines don't need any indentation at all.

                    If the enemy tries to crack the code, they will get some false info to waste their time.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Make your own secret code for your superspy and return both parts only to the real spy.

                    ### Exercise 2

                    Complete the code by filling the right command on the blank. Tip: The superspy has to answer BOTH questions correctly, before they get the confidential information!

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We want to confuse the enemy even more! Create a list with fake answers and select one at random when a wrong answer is given.
                example_code: |

                    Let's make a game of Simon Says! Simon Says is a memory game in which the player will be given a color. They have to repeat that color back.
                    If they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.

                    ***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
                    Then make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.
                    At the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.

                    ***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.
                    We do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.
                    Then create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.

                    ***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).
                    So we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.

                    ***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.
                    Remove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next adventure to learn more about the simon says game!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Make 2 lists

                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous level here. Don't forget to remove the part that was just used for testing the functions.

                    ***Create a function that creates the player_sequence*** The list `player_sequence` is used to capture the answers of the player. First we define the function with the argument level.
                    Next, we ask level times what the color is that they choose. We call that variable `answer`. Then we add the variable `answer` to the list player_sequence.

                    ***Setting up the game*** Before we program the game in the next adventure, we'll need some starting variables. First, we'll set the variable `level` to 1 and the variable `game_over` to False.
                    Then we make an introduction for the game. We'll print 'Welcome to Simon Says!' and clear the screen after 1 second.

                    ***Continue to the next adventure to finish the game!**** Don't forget to copy your code and take it with you to the next adventure.

                    In this adventure we'll program the game of Simon Says!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous adventure and paste it here.

                    ***Program the game*** We start by making sure the game goes on while the game isn't over. Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.
                    Now, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself. To create the list we use the same trick as we did in the previous tab.
                    We'll make a list with the words 'empty' and 'list' on it, and then we remove both these words. Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.
                    Lastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).
                    If that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.
                    Did the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'

                    ```
                    number = 6
                    number = number - 1
                    {print} number ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'
                    {print} 'One fell off and bumped his head'
                    {print} 'Mama called the doctor and the doctor said'
                    {print} 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    ### Exercise
                    You can print the song Baby Shark with a `{repeat}`? Finish the code by replacing the blanks?
                    **Extra** After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition!
                    Can you think of one more song and print it?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. But without the `{repeat}` command, you had to copy the verses many times.
                    In this level you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the right command on the blanks and indent the code correctly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    _ 99 {times}
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    With `{for}` you can print make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you make the baby shark code even shorter by using a `{for}` command? Finish the example code.
                example_code: "```\nfamily = baby, mammy, daddy, grandma, grandpa\n_ _ _ _ \n  {print} _\n```\n"

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Print the song Five little moneys jumping on the bed. Look up the text if you don't remember.

                    **Extra** Print the song Old MacDonald had a farm, and make sure all animals make a different sound, using an `{if}`.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    monkeys = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
                    ```
            11:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the `{for}` with `{range}` to make songs that use counting, like the 5 little monkeys.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work! If you don't remember the song text, look it up yourself.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    The final line of the song is different from the others. Print this line inside the `{for}`, and use an `{if}` to make it work correctly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ monkeys _ _ 5 _ 1
                        {print} monkeys ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'

                    In this song we can make it even easier to program 'if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands'. Because we can put all of the actions in a variable, check it out:

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you add the right amount of indentation to each line to make the song play correctly?
                    Hint: Not all lines need indentation.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ actions = 'clap your hands', 'stomp your feet', 'shout Hurray!'
                    _ {for} action {in} actions
                    _ {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 2
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it'
                    _ {print} action
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'

                    In this level, you can program a song like OldMacDonald even more quickly. You can connect the right animal to the right sound by simply putting them in the same place in the list.
                    The Drunken Sailor is also quickly made in this level. You only need 8 lines for the entire song, check it out!

                    ### Exercise
                    Complete the Old MacDonald song by setting the variable `animal` to `animals[i]` and `sound` to `sounds[i]`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    Let's program a game of tic-tac-toe!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we'll start with creating an empty field.

                    ***Create a list called field*** This list will be our playing field. This list is filled with 9 dots, since there are no x's and o's yet at the start of our game.

                    ***Create a function that prints the field*** Firstly, clear the screen so the old playing fields will be removed. Then we print the first line of our Tic Tac Toe field. This line constists of the first 3 spots in our list field.
                    We have already programmed this line for you. Now finish the field by printing spot 4, 5, and 6 on the second row and spot 7, 8 and 9 in the third row.

                    ***Call the function that prints the field*** Now call the function.
                    <div class="w-full flex flex-row gap-2">
                        Run the code. Your output should look like this: <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/bcbd156e-4b48-4e82-84ae-f86d21b0cbcc" width="100">
                    </div>

                    ***Continue in the next adventure*** In the next adventure you'll learn how to program the game itself.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Create a list called field
                    _ = ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

                    # Create a function that prints the field
                    {define} print_field
                        _
                        {print} 'TIC TAC TOE'
                        {print} field[1] field[2] field[3]
                        _
                        _

                    # Call the function

                    In the previous level you've learned how to make a tic-tac-toe game. The game works, but is quite annoying as it keeps asking you if you've won yet.
                    Now that we have the {elif} command, we can let the game decide if someone has won and it can stop asking us!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Paste your code from the previous level here and make it level 17 proof. In this level you've learned to use a colon everytime you create a block of code. Please add the colons in the correct spots.

                    ***Create a function that detects if someone's won*** We have started the function for you, paste it under the function `print_field` and finish the function. You can see that this first piece of code checks to see if spot 1, 2 and 3 are the same, because if they are you have 3 in a row.
                    It also checks if they are not a dot, because if they are, the line might have the same symbols on them, but that's just because it's still empty.
                    If all these conditions are met, the game is over and the winner is printed.
                    Finish this function with all possible ways to win. This means you have to make this for the other 2 rows, 3 columns and 2 diagonals.
                    If you've finished all the other options, the function should return the variable `game_over` so we can use it in our game.

                    ***Call the function in the game*** Go to the line `game_over = {ask} 'Did you win?'` and change it to `game_over = {call} detect_winner {with} field, sign`. Now the function will check if there's a winner and the game doesn't need to keep asking anymore!

                    ***Enjoy your game!*** Great job! You have finished the game! Enjoy playing it!

                    In the previous adventure you've learned how to create a playing field. Now you'll learn how to create the game!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Start by pasting your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Add variables*** Underneath your list called `field` we'll add 2 more variables that we'll need to program the game.
                    The variable `game_over` tells us if the game is over, and should be 'no' at the start of the game.
                    The variable `sign` tells us if it's the turn of player x or player o. Set the variable to 'x'.

                    ***The game*** First use a {while} command, to make sure the game keeps on playing the variable while game_over is set to no.
                    During the game, we first ask the player which spot they choose. Then we change the field with the number they chose into their sign.
                    Then we print the field again and we ask the player if they've won yet. Lastly we want to switch whose turn it is, so if the sign is 'x' it should be 'o' and the other way around.

                    ***Test your game*** Does your game work? Great, have fun playing the game! If not, use the ladybug button to debug your code.
                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code though, you can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! Go to the next adventure to learn how to fix this problem.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    # Add variables
                    game_over = _
                    sign = _

                    # The game
                    {while} _
                        choice = _ 'Player ' sign '_?'
                        field[choice] = _
                        _ print_field
                        game_over = {ask} _
                        {if} sign = 'o'
                            sign = _
                        _
                            sign = _

                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code you've made in the previous adventure. You can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! In this adventure we'll fix that mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Fix the mistake*** To fix the mistake we replace the line that says `field[choice] = sign`. This turns any spot that the player has chosen into their sign.
                    Go to the header that says 'Use this to fix the mistake' and finish the code. We first want to check if the chosen spot is still empty, so `if field[choice] = '.'`. If that is the case, you are allowed to take it.
                    Then we make an else command and print 'Sorry, this spot is already taken' if the spot is not empty. Lastly, we add a {sleep} command, so the players can actually read the text before it gets cleared again.
                    Now copy this piece of code and replace the line `field[choice] = sign` with this new piece of code.

                    ***Play your game!*** Now the game should work properly! Good job!
                    The only flaw is that you can get a bit annoyed that the game keeps asking you if you've won yet. Do you want to fix that? Go to level 17 and we'll fix it!

                    {if} _ = '.'
                        field[choice] = sign
                    {else}

                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.

                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 100
                    {turn} {left}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 20
                    {turn} {right}
                    {forward} 20
                    {turn} {left}
                    {forward} 20
                    ```
            2:
                story_text: |
                    In level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions. 

                    Use 90 degrees to turn a quarter, 180 to turn half, and a full circle is 360 degrees.

                    ### Exercise
                    This code now creates the letter T. Can you change it to make the letter B?

                    **Extra** Change the letter into a different letter, like the first one of your name. 
                    You can also make multiple letters, by setting the color to `{color}` `{white}` in between. 

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 80
                    {turn} 90
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} 180
                    {forward} 100
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    You can use variables to in the turtle `turn`. 

                    ### Exercise
                    Change the code such that it creates a triangle. Hint: you only have to change the code in one place.

                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Drawing figures
                    angle {is} 90
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    ```
            3:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use `{at} {random}` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list.
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles {is} 10, 50, 90, 150, 250
                    {turn} angles {at} {random}
                    {forward} 25
                    ```
            4:
                story_text: |
                    In level 4 you have to use quotation marks with `{print}` and `{ask}`. Also when drawing!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} _ Drawing figures _
                    angle {is} 90
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    You can also change the color of the lines with the command `{color}`. Check out the example.
                    You can also use the command `{color} {white}` to make 'invisible' lines. You could use these white lines to move the turtle anywhere in the screen before you start drawing.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {color} {white}
                    {forward} -80
                    {color} {green}
                    {forward} 50
                    {color} {yellow}
                    {forward} 50
                    {color} {red}
                    {forward} 50
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In level 5 you can make a choice with `{if}`. For example between different types of figures.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Drawing Figures'
                    figure {is} {ask} 'Do you want a square or a triangle?'
                    {if} figure {is} triangle angle {is} 120
                    {else} angle {is} 90
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the correct numbers in this code to get it to work.
                    After you've done that, you can try to add the option backwards.

                    **Extra** Instead of using 'left' and 'right', remake the program with North, East, South and West.
                    This way you could add even more directions like Northeast and Southwest etc.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    direction {is} {ask} 'Do you want to go left, right, or straight ahead?'
                    {if} direction {is} left {turn} _
                    {if} direction {is} right {turn} _
                    {forward} 100
                    ```

                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles = {ask} 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle = 360 / angles
                    {forward} 50

                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **Extra** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.

                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                    **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {turn} 90

                    We can use functions to draw more complex figures with less code.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill the function so that three squares are created. If you want the image to look nicer, you can make the lines between the squares white.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    The code can be made even shorter. Place the final lines into a `{repeat}` so the figure remains the same.

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Create your own drawing with different figures.
                    Change both the number of figures with the `{repeat}` and the shape of the figures in the `{define}`

                    ### Exercise
                    Create a program that asks the player how many corners their figure should have and then creates that figure.
                    The figure in the image is the output when the player fills in 10.

                    A star is usually drawn using 144-degree-turns. If you change this slightly to 143 degrees for example and repeat the pattern multiple times with a {while} loop you can make this figure.

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!

                    In this level you can use the `{for}` number `{in}` `{range}` command to countdown to the New Year.

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work!
