            1:
                story_text: |
                    No nível 1 podes criar uma história com um personagem principal diferente, saído da tua imaginação.

                    Como primeira linha, usa este código `{ask}`.

                    Após a primeira linha, começa com `print` se quiseres que a frase seja escrita.
                    Utilizas `echo` se quiseres colocar o teu personagem principal no final da frase.
                example_code: "```\nask O(A) personagem principal desta história é ...\nprint O(A) personagem principal vai caminhar agora na floresta\necho Está um pouco(a) assustado(a) \nprint Ouve barulhos estranhos por toda a parte\nprint Receia que esta floresta seja assombrada\n```\n\nÉ uma pena\
                    \ só conseguires criar frases em que o nome do personagem principal aparece no final, certo? Depois de praticarmos com esta história, prossegue para o nível 2 e, a seguir, para o nível 3, onde podes criar programas cada vez mais complexos.\n"

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story in Hedy now by using `{print}` , `{ask}` and `{echo}`?
                start_code: print A tua história começa aqui
            2:
                story_text: |
                    No nível 2 podes tornar a tua história ainda mais divertida. O nome da tua personagem principal pode agora aparecer em qualquer parte da frase.

                    Precisas de programar algumas coisas extra, para conseguires isso. Tens de atribuir o nome ao teu personagem principal, primeiro de tudo.

                    Depois, podes colocar esse nome em qualquer lugar da frase.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    nome is ask Qual é o nome da tua personagem principal?
                    print nome vai agora correr na floresta
                    print nome está um pouco assustado(a)
                    print Está a ouvir barulhos estranhos por toda a parte
                    print nome receia que esta floresta seja assombrada
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.
                start_code: print A tua história
            3:
                story_text: |
                    Podes também acrescentar algo aleatório à tua história. Pode ser um monstro, um animal ou qualquer outro obstáculo.

                    Podemos fazê-lo da seguinte maneira.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animais {is} coruja, cobra, raposa
                    {print} Agora consegue ouvir o barulho de uma animais {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story. For example
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} He hears a sound
                    animals {is} 🐿, 🦔, 🦇, 🦉
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
                start_code: print 'A tua história será escrita aqui!'
            4:
                story_text: |
                    Podes ter notado que ainda existe um erro no nível 2.

                    Por acaso, tentaste construir uma frase que continha a palavra nome? E.g. `print o meu nome é nome`.

                    Não funciona nada bem! O que obténs: o meu Manuel é Manuel. Podes consertar isto no nível 3.

                    Precisas usar aspas simples para tudo aquilo que queres escrever.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    nome is Ricardo
                    print 'O nome da personagem principal é' nome
                    print nome 'vai passear pela floresta'
                    print nome 'está um pouco assustado'
                    animais is coruja, cobra, raposa
                    print 'Ele ouve um som de uma' animais at random
                    print nome 'tem medo que a floresta seja assombrada'
                    ```
                start_code: print 'A tua história será escrita aqui!'
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Here your story will start!'''
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```
                start_code: '{repeat} 5 {times} {print} ''Help!'''
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} '💥ZAP!💥'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!🦖'
                    ```

            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'

                        {print} animal
                        {print} animal
                        {print} 'What do you see?'

                    In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.
                example_code: |4


                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'

                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.
                example_code: |4

                    ```

                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game {is} 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword {is} 'lost'` so the player can't continu the game until they have found something.
                example_code: |4

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!

                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.

                    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two `{if}`s but can use `{and}` and `{or}`.

                    If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    ## The ask command
                    Now that you can use the `{print}` command, you are ready to learn the next command: `{ask}`. With the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question. Check it out:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!

                    {echo} hello

                    ### Exercise
                    Try out the `{ask}` and `{echo}` commands. Firstly, fill in the blanks to make this program work.
                    Then ask 2 more questions using the `{ask}` command, after each `{ask}` use an `{echo}` to print the answer on the screen.

                    ## The ask command
                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.
                    Check it out:

                    This way your code is becoming interactive!

                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} What is your name?
                    {print} Hello name
                    age {is} {ask} How old are you?
                    {print} name is age years old.
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    In the previous tab you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous tab and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animals is ask What is your favorite animal?
                    print I like favorite_animals
                    ```

                    {print} Hello name
                    age {is} {ask} How old are you?

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    Have fun!

                    With a `{for}` you can simplify tables of multiplication practise program.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    number = 10
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 to 10
                        {print} i * number

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2 (extra)
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer1 = {ask} 'What is 10 times 7?'
                    answer2 = {ask} 'What is 6 times 7?'
                    {if} _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                        {print} _

                    Se usares o código `nome is Hedy`, podes colocar nome em qualquer parte do teu código, que será automaticamente substituído por Hedy.

                    `ask` funciona no nível 4 tal como funcionava no nível 3, mas `print` está diferente agora.

                     Tens de colocar o texto que queres escrever entre aspas simples.

                     Isto é útil, porque agora podes escrever todas as palavras que queres. O mesmo se aplica às palavras com que costumavas guardar algo usando `is`.

                     A maioria das linguagens de programação também usam aspas simples quando querem escrever, por isso, estamos um passo mais próximos da realidade da programação!

                     Vais encontrar os comandos à esquerda, novamente, e as tarefas nos separadores seguintes. À medida que avanças pelos separadores, as tarefas vão ficando mais difíceis.
                     Por isso, é melhor começares pela esquerda na história e ires avançando para a direita, para que o desafio vá aumentando, gradualmente.

                     Este código escreve Fixe! se colocares Hedy como nome e boo! se colocares outra coisa qualquer.


                     Também no nível 5 as tarefas que vais encontrar nos separadores estão a tornar-se mais difíceis. Por isso, completa-as da esquerda para a direita.

                    `ask`, `print` e `if` ainda funcionam como nos nível 5.
                     Mas no nível 6 temos algo novo, também podes fazer cálculos.

                     No nível 6 acrescentamos novos símbolos e agora tu podes fazer cálculos dentro do teu código.

                     A soma é fácil, escreves tal como fazes em Matemática: `5 + 5`, por exemplo. A subtração também funciona na perfeição, é `5 - 5`.

                     A multiplicação é um pouco diferente, porque não existe o símbolo de multiplicar no teu teclado. Podes procurar à vontade, não existe mesmo!
                     Por esse motivo, multiplicamos utilizando o asterisco: `5 * 5`. Lê isto como 5 vezes 5 e assim será mais fácil memorizar.

                    Isto significa colocar quatro espaços no início da linha. Isto também se aplica quando quiseres apenas criar um bloco só de uma linha.

                    Se juntares um `repeat` e um `if`, terás de indentar cada bloco. Observa o exemplo de código para mais detalhes!"

                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something {else}.
                example_code: |4

                    ```

                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:
                example_code: |4

                    ```

                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm points = points + 5 {else} points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code_2: |4

                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    ## For
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.

                story_text: |
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.

                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene

                    In this level you can use the `{repeat}` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but {if} not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and {ask} the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} How did I get here?
                    {print} I remember my friend telling me to go into the old mansion...
                    {print} and suddenly everything went black.
                    {print} But how did I end up on the floor...?
                    {print} My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
                    {print} What's that sound?
                    {print} Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
                    {print} I need to get out of here!
                    {print} There are 3 doors in front of me..
                    {ask} Which door should i pick?
                    {echo} I choose door
                    {print} ...?

                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.
                    {print} But as you enter monster_3 attacks you!

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animals`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we haved used the variable in a print command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animals is _
                    {print} I like favorite_animals
                    ```
                start_code: |-
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old

                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
            14:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```
                start_code: |-
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'

                    In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.

                    In this level you can make a list using the `{is}` command. You can let the computer choose a random item from that list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` and `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!
                    In the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.
                    Give it a try!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes {repeat} 2 {times} {print} 'You knew that already!'
                    {else} {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'You have learned something new!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ## Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'

                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'

                    In this level you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.
                example_code: |
                    You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:

                    In this level you've learned how to use the {repeat} command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to {ask} multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:
                example_code: |

                    In this level you can use nesting to make your restaurant more realistic and more fun!
                    For example you would {ask} for sauce {if} somebody orders fries, but you wouldn't {if} someone orders pizza!
                    Check out the example, and try this at your own virtual restaurant!
                example_code: |

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    This children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.
                    If you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the the code, you can sing the whole song!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    number = 6

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |4

                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    In level 16 we made songs using lists. These programs however are no longer working properly in this level. The colons from level 17 and the brackets from level 18 still need to be added.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Now also look up your Old MacDonald song from level 16, and correct it.

                    In this adventure you can program a game of Tic Tac Toe. You can play with two people. Taking turns, you pick a number of the spot (1 - 9) you want to put your sign (x or o) on.
                    The first player that gets 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins!
                    Have fun!

                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.

                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`

                    ### Exercise

                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    Fill in the correct numbers in this code to get it to work.
                    After you've done that, you can try to add the option backwards.

                    **Extra** Instead of using 'left' and 'right', remake the program with North, East, South and West.
                    This way you could add even more directions like Northeast and Southwest etc.

                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |4

                    Now that we can use a `{repeat}` inside a `{repeat}`, we can create more complex figures.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **(extra)** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {color} {black}
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        {repeat} 3 {times}
                            {forward} 10
                            {turn} 120
                        {color} {white}
                        {forward} 50
                        {color} {black}

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer = 0
                    {while} answer != 25
                        answer = {ask} 'What is 5 times 5?'
                    {print} 'A correct answer has been given'

                    In this level you can use the `{for} i {in} {range}` command to countdown to the New Year.

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work!

                    for _ in _ 10 to 1
                        {print} i
                    {print} 'Happy New Year!'
