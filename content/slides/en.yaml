          text: |
            Hedy is a programming language.
        2:
          header: "Programming"
          text: |
            Programming is giving instructions to a computer, using the language of the computer.

            Such a language is called a "programming language".
        3:
          header: "Programming Language"
          text: |
            Maybe you already know some programming languages?
            Some examples are:
            * Scratch
            * Python
            * HTML

          text: |
            If you can program, you can do many cool things:
            * Build interactive stories
            * Create computer drawings and draw these on paper or fabric
            * Build your own apps to use on your phone
        5:
          header: "Programming in Hedy"
          text: |
            In Hedy we use special codes, like `{print}`.

          header: "Welcome to level 1!"
          text: |
               We will start level 1 by making stories in Hedy!

               We need three text codes to create interactive stories.

        2:
          header: "{print}"
          text: |
              The first code that you can use in level 1 is `{print}`.

              `{print}` is used to show text on the screen.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/print_command/1/raw"></iframe>
        3:
          header: "The {print} command"
          text: |
            You can change the text after the print command to whatever you want.

            Or you could print multiple lines by adding another line of code that also starts with `{print}`.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/print_command/1/raw"></iframe>
        4:
            header: "{ask} "
            text: |
              The second code that you can use in level 1 is `{ask}`.

              `{ask}` is used to ask a question that can be answered.
            editor: |
              <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/rock/1/raw"></iframe>
        5:
            header: "{echo}"
            text: |
              As you could see in the previous example. If you use the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question.

              The answer, however doesn't show in the output screen.

              If you do want the answer to show, you can use the final command of this level: `{echo}`.

              `{echo}` is used to repeat the answer of an `{ask}`.
            editor: |
              <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/ask_command/1/raw"></iframe>
        6:
            header: "Programming!"
            text: |
              With `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
              This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.
        7:
            header: "Programming!"
            text: |
              Adventures are shown in tabs.

            text: |
               Now that we have seen at text codes, we will now look at drawing codes next.
        10:
            header: "Drawing with the turtle: {forward}"
            text: |
               `{forward}` is used to move the turtle forward.

        1:
          header: "Welcome to level 2"
          text: |
            In this level you will learn to use variables.

            A variable is a word that can be used to store informatie.

            For example: a name, age or favorite sports team.
        2:
          header: "Variables"
          text: |
            To make or 'set' a variable we use the `{is}` command
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/is_command/2/raw"></iframe>
        3:
          header: "Interactive"
          text: |
            We can also set a variable by asking questions.

            The answer to the question is stored in the variable.

            This way we don't need the `{echo}`  command.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/ask_command/2/raw"></iframe>
        4:
          header: "Multiple variables"
          text: |
            Now that we use variables, we can use multiple variables instead of just one `{echo}`command.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/ask_command/2/raw"></iframe>
        5:
          header: "Sleep"
          text: |
            You can also use the `{sleep}` command to pause the code for a while.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/sleep_command/2/raw"></iframe>
        6:
          header: "Sleep 5"
          text: |
            You can add a number after the `{sleep}` command if you want the pause to be longer.

            If you want, you could even use a variable instead of a number to decide the duration of the sleep command.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/sleep_command/2/raw"></iframe>

        1:
          header: "Welcome to level 3"
          text: |
            In this level you'll learn how to make a list, add and remove items form your lists and pick a random item off that list.
        2:
          header: "Making a list"
          text: |
            You make a list with `{is}`.

            Seperate the items on your list with a comma.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/random_command/3/raw"></iframe>
        3:
          header: "At random"
          text: |
            You can use the list with the `{at}` `{random}` command.
            The computer will randomly pick one item of the list.
            Every time you run this code the output will differ.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/dice/3/raw"></iframe>
        4:
          header: "At random in a sentence"
          text: |
            You can use the `{at}` `{random}` command in a sentence as well.

            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/random_command/3/raw"></iframe>
        5:
          header: "Add to"
          text: |
            You can add items to a list with the `{add}` `{to}` command.

            You can choose what to add to the list or you can use the `{add}` `{to}` command in combination with the `{ask}` command.
            This way you can let the player decide what to add to the list.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/add_remove_command/3/raw"></iframe>
        6:
          header: "Remove from"
          text: |
            The opposite of the `{add}` `{to}` command is the  `{remove}` `{from}` command.
            This command removes an item from a list.

        1:
          header: "Welcome to level 4"
          text: |
            In this level you will learn how to use quotation marks.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/quotation_marks/4/raw"></iframe>
        2:
          header: "Problem"
          text: |
            In the previous levels, you might have come across this problem:
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/default/4/raw"></iframe>
        3:
          header: "Fixing it with quotation marks"
          text: |
            In this level we will fix this problem by using quotation marks.

            This also makes our code look more like 'real' Python code.
        4:
          header: "Quotation marks with print"
          text: |
              Each time you use the `{print}` command you need to put the text that you want to appear on the screen in quotation marks.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/quotation_marks/4/raw"></iframe>
        5:
          header: "Quotation marks with ask"
          text: |
            This also goes for the `{ask}` command.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/quotation_marks/4/raw"></iframe>
        6:
          header: "Quotation marks and variables"
          text: |
            You do not want variable names to be printed on the screen.
            This is why variables should be left out of the quotation marks, like this:
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/quotation_marks/4/raw"></iframe>
        7:
          header: "Quotation marks and variables"
          text: |
            When variable names are used in the middle of a sentence, you have to leave the variables out of the quotation marks.
            The rest of the sentence however, does need quotation marks. That looks like this:
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/quotation_marks/4/raw"></iframe>
        8:
          header: "Quotation marks and contractions"
          text: |
            Be careful! Now that you are using quotation marks, you can't use apostrophes in contractions.

            Please try to print a contraction like "you're" or "I'm" in the screen below and see what happens....

          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/rock/4/raw"></iframe>
        9:
          header: "Clear"
          text: |
            In this level you'll also learn the {clear} command.
            With this command you can wipe all the text from your output screen.

            Be careful that you always use a sleep command too. If you don't the computer will wipe all the text before you can read it!

          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/clear_command/4/raw"></iframe>
        10:

    5:
        1:
          header: "Welcome to level 5"
          text: |
            In this level you will learn to use 3 new commands: `{if}`, `{else}` and `{in}`.
        2:
          header: "if"
          text: |
            The `{if}` command allows you to choose between two options.
            In this example the computer will print 'nice' if the given answer is Hedy.
            If the answer is not Hedy, the computer will do nothing.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/5/raw"></iframe>
        3:
          header: "Don't forget to print"
          text: |
            When using the `{if}` command, don't forget to use the `{print}` command.
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/5/raw"></iframe>
        4:
          header: "else"
          text: |
            When using an `{if}` command, you can also add an `{else}` command.
            If the answer is Hedy, the computer will print 'nice'.
            But if the answer is something else the computer will print 'boo'
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/5/raw"></iframe>
        5:
          header: "Long lines"
          text: |
            You might have noticed that your lines can get very long when you have both an `{if}` and an `{else}` command.

            You can choose to seperate commands and put them on 2 lines, like this:
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/5/raw"></iframe>
        6:
          header: 'Another new command'
          text: |
            If you have practised with the `{if}` and `{else}` commands, you can also try the `{in}` command.

            With `{in}` you can let the computer check if an item is in a list, for example:

            Please note that Hedy is case sensitive. This means that if you answer "Green" instead of "green", Hedy will print "meh".

      7:
        header: "The = symbol"
        text: |
          From now on you can also use the = symbol instead of the `{is}` command.
          This goes for both numbers and words, and it also goes after the `{if}` or `{else}` commands.

      2:
        header: "repeat 3 times"
        text: |
          If you want to repeat a line of code, you can use the `{repeat}` 3 `{times}` code.
          If you want to repeat the line more times, simply change the number.

          For example: If you are programming a story where your character shouts for help for 5 times, it could look like this:

        header: "{repeat} commands now"
        text: |
          In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code. To do this you must tell the computer which lines belong together and should be repeated.
          You do this by using indentation.

          Use 4 spaces (or one tab) at the beginning of each line that you want to repeat, like this:
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/repeat_command/8/raw"></iframe>
      4:
        header: "{repeat} commands now"
        text: |
          If you want to, you can continue after the `{repeat}` command without indentation.
          The lines that do not start with indentation will not be repeated.
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/repeat_command_2/8/raw"></iframe>
      5:
        header: "if and else before"
        text: |
          The same goes for the `{if}` and `{else}` commands.
          These were the commands before:
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/5/raw"></iframe>
      6:
        header: "if and else now"
        text: |
          These are the `{if}` and `{else}` commands now.
          Each line after the `{if}` and `{else}` commands start with indentation.
        editor:
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/8/raw"></iframe>
      7:
        header: "stopping the indentation"
        text: |
          Just like with the `{repeat}` command, you can stop using indentation and the lines will always be shown. Not just if the statement is true.
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/8/raw"></iframe>
      8:
        header: "if statements inside if statements"
        text: |
          You might have thought of trying to put an if command inside a repeat command, or inside another if command.
          For now, this is not possible yet. In the higher levels, it will be allowed, but for now let's focus on practising the `{if}` `{else}` and `{repeat}` commands with proper indentation first.

    9:
      1:
        header: "Welcome to level 9"
        text: |
          In this level you can use multiple lines of code after an `{if}` or after a `{repeat}` command.

          You can even put a `{repeat}` command within another `{repeat}`  command.
      2:
        header: "Multiple lines after `{repeat}`"
        text: |
          You are allowed to use multiple lines after `{repeat}`.

      3:
        header: "Indentation matters!"
        text: |
          Indentation is very important to tell the computer which lines should be repeated and which lines should only be ran once.
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/repeat_command_2/8/raw"></iframe>
      4:
        header: "Multipe lines after `{if}`"
        text: |
          You can also use multiple lines after `{if}`
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/9/raw"></iframe>
      5:
        header: "Indentation matters"
        text: |
          Again, indentation is still very important and can make a big difference in the code.

          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/if_command/9/raw"></iframe>
      6:
        header: "An `{if}` inside a `{repeat}`"

      1:
        header: "Welcome to level 10"
        text: |
          In this level you will learn a new command: `{for}`.
      2:
        header: "The for command"
        text: |
          With for you can make a list and use all items on that list. `{for}` creates a block, like repeat and if so all lines in the block need to start with indentation (4 spaces).
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/for_command/10/raw"></iframe>
      3:
        header: "The for command"
        text: |
          Here you see another example of the `{for}` command:

    11:
      1:
        header: "Welcome to level 11"
        text: |
          In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}` command. In earlier levels, we used for with a list, but we can also use for with numbers.

          This way we don't need the `{repeat}` command anymore.
      2:
        header: "The for command"
        text: |
          This is what the new for command looks like:

      3:
        header: "the variable i"
        text: |
          In the previous slide the variable was named 'counter', because it was counting down.
          You can of course use any name for the variable you want.
          The standard name  for variables in this situation that is used in programming languages like Python is 'i'.
          That looks like this:

          From this level on you are allowed to use decimal numbers and there are some changes to the quotation marks.
      2:
        header: "Quotation marks"
        text: |
          This level makes some changes to the usage of quotation marks.
          From now on, **all texts** need to be in quotation marks. This includes values of variables, items on lists and text after {if} commands.
        editor: |
          <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/quotation_marks/12/raw"></iframe>
      3:
        header: "Decimal numbers"
        text: |
          From this level on you are also allowed to use decimal numbers. This can make programs like your restaurant even better!

          Numbers do not quotation marks.

          header: "Welcome to level 13"
          text: |
            We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two ifs but can use and and or.
        2:
          header: "The and command"
          text: |
            The `{and}` command is always used in a combination with the {if} command.
            This way you can check if 2 statements are true. For example:
          editor: |
            <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/and_or_command/13/raw"></iframe>
        3:
          header: "The or command"
          text: |
            The `{or}` works in the same way as the `{and}` command, but only 1 of the two statements has to be true.

            Let's see what happens when you change the `{and}` for `{or}`.

      2:
        header: "Symbols"
        text: |
          These are the new symbols you can use:

            The >  means bigger than...

            The >= means bigger than or the same as...

            The <  means smaller than...

            The <= means smaller than or the same as...

          You can use them like this:

          You can also use:

          == is the same as.

          != is not

      2:
        header: "{while}"
        text: |
          We are going to learn a new loop, the while loop! The loop continues as long as the statement is true. So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

          In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given. If the correct answer is never given, the loop will never end!

        text: |
          We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels. We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. The at random command can not be used anymore.

          Congratulations! You have reached the last level of Hedy! The code you have created here can be copied to real Python environments like replit or PyCharm, and you can continue learning there! Note however that Python can only read English commands, so if you have been using other languages, you will need to switch to English now.
      2:
        header: "The Python way"
        text: |
          We arrived at real Python code! That means we need to use parentheses with print and range from now on.

          Also, if you want to print more than one item, you need to separate them by commas.

          The final change we will need to make to get Python code is changing ask into input.

          Click on the 'print' tab for all the examples.
