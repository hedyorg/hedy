                The second code that you can use in level 1 is `{ask}`.

                `{ask}` is used to ask a question that can be answered.
            code: |-
                {print} Welcome to your own rock scissors paper!
                {ask} What will you choose?

            header: 'Hedy level 1: {echo}'
            text: |-
                The final text code that you can use in level 1 is `{echo}`.

                `{echo}` is used to repeat the answer of an `{ask}`.
            code: |-
                {print} Hello!
                {ask} What is your name?
                {echo} hello

                with `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
                This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.

                Voimme myös asettaa muuttujan esittämällä kysymyksiä.

                Vastaus kysymykseen on tallennettu muuttujaan.

                Tällä tavalla emme tarvitse `{echo}`-komentoa.

            text: Now that we use variables, we can use multiple variables instead of just one `{echo}`command.
