            text: |-
                The second code that you can use in level 1 is `{ask}`.

                `{ask}` is used to ask a question that can be answered.
            code: |-
                {print} Welcome to your own rock scissors paper!
                {ask} What will you choose?

            header: 'Hedy level 1: {echo}'
            text: |-
                The final text code that you can use in level 1 is `{echo}`.

                `{echo}` is used to repeat the answer of an `{ask}`.
            code: |-
                {print} Hello!
                {ask} What is your name?
                {echo} hello
        5:
            header: Programming!
            text: |-
                with `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
                This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.

                We can also set a variable by asking questions.

                The answer to the question is stored in the variable.

                This way we don't need the `{echo}`  command.
        4:
            text: Now that we use variables, we can use multiple variables instead of just one `{echo}`command.
            code: "name {is} {ask} What is your name?\n{print} Hello name\nage {is} {ask} How old are you?\n{print} name is age years old।"
        5:
            text: You can also use the `{sleep}` command to pause the code for a while।
        6:
            text: "You can add a number after the `{sleep}` command if you want the pause to be longer.\n\nIf you want, you could even use a variable instead of a number to decide the duration of the sleep command।"

            text: "In this level we will fix this problem by using quotation marks.\n\nThis also makes our code look more like 'real' Python code।"
        5:
            text: This also goes for the `{ask}` command।
        1:
            text: In this level you will learn how to use quotation marks।
        4:
            text: Each time you use the `{print}` command you need to put the text that you want to appear on the screen in quotation marks।
        8:
            text: "Be careful! Now that you are using quotation marks, you can't use apostrophes in contractions.\n\nPlease try to print a contraction like \"you're\" or \"I'm\" in the screen below and see what happens...।"
    17:
        1:
            text: in this level you will learn how to use a colon and you will learn the elif command।
        2:
            text: 'Now we are going to change indentation a little bit. Every time that we need an indentation, we need : at the line before the indentation।'
    16:
        1:
            text: In this level you will learn about the [square brackets] and how to use them।
        2:
            text: We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels. We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. The at random command can not be used anymore।
    3:
        1:
            text: In this level you'll learn how to make a list, add and remove items form your lists and pick a random item off that list।
        3:
            text: "You can use the list with the `{at}` `{random}` command.\nThe computer will randomly pick one item of the list.\nEvery time you run this code the output will differ।"
        6:
            text: "The opposite of the `{add}` `{to}` command is the  `{remove}` `{from}` command.\nThis command removes an item from a list।"
        4:
            text: You can use the `{at}` `{random}` command in a sentence as well।
        5:
            text: "You can add items to a list with the `{add}` `{to}` command.\n\nYou can choose what to add to the list or you can use the `{add}` `{to}` command in combination with the `{ask}` command.\nThis way you can let the player decide what to add to the list।"
        2:
            text: "You make a list with `{is}`.\n\nSeparate the items on your list with a comma।"

        2:
            text: "The `{if}` command allows you to choose between two options.\nIn this example the computer will print 'nice' if the given answer is Hedy.\nIf the answer is not Hedy, the computer will do nothing।"
        
    7:
        3:
            text: If you want to subtract, you can use the minus sign।
        7:
            text: "From now on you can also use the = symbol instead of the `{is}` command.\nThis goes for both numbers and words, and it also goes after the `{if}` or `{else}` commands।"
        6:
            text: In summary, you can use +, -, * and / to do maths।
        4:

    8:
        3:
            text: When using the repeat command, do not forget the `{print}` command।
        1:
            text: In this level you will learn how to repeat a line of code as many times a you'd like।
        4:
            text: You can also repeat an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command multiple times।
    9:
        7:
            text: Just like with the `{repeat}` command, you can stop using indentation and the lines will always be shown. Not just if the statement is true।
        2:
            text: "In the previous levels, the `{repeat}` command looked like this:\n\nYou could only repeat one line of code।"
        4:
            text: "If you want to, you can continue after the `{repeat}` command without indentation.\nThe lines that do not start with indentation will not be repeated।"
        8:
            text: "You might have thought of trying to put an if command inside a repeat command, or inside another if command.\nFor now, this is not possible yet. In the higher levels, it will be allowed, but for now let's focus on practising the `{if}` `{else}` and `{repeat}` commands with proper indentation first।"
        1:
            text: In this level you will learn to use indentation to make the `{repeat}`, `{if}` and `{else}` commands work for multiple lines of code।
        6:
            text: "These are the `{if}` and `{else}` commands now.\nEach line after the `{if}` and `{else}` commands start with indentation।"
    10:
        5:
            text: Again, indentation is still very important and can make a big difference in the code।
        2:
            text: You are allowed to combine `{repeat}` and `{if}` in this level।
        3:
            text: Indentation is very important to tell the computer which lines should be repeated and which lines should only be ran once।
        7:
            text: Mind that the fourth and sixth line of this code starts with 8 spaces of indentation।
        1:
            text: "In this level you can use multiple lines of code after an `{if}` or after a `{repeat}` command.\n\nYou can even put a `{repeat}` command within another `{repeat}`  command।"
    11:
        4:
            text: "In this level you'll learn how to use functions. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again. To create a function, use define and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the define line. Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!\n\nNow, whenever we need that block of code, we just use call with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again।"
        2:
            text: "This level makes some changes to the usage of quotation marks.\nFrom now on, **all texts** need to be in quotation marks. This includes values of variables, items on lists and text after {if} commands।"
        3:
            text: "From this level on you are also allowed to use decimal numbers. This can make programs like your restaurant even better!\n\nNumbers do not need quotation marks।"
        6:
            text: As you could see in the example a function is a block of code that can be called anytime. You use `{define}` to set the function and `{call}` to use it।
    12:
        1:
            text: "In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}` command. In earlier levels, we used for with a list, but we can also use for with numbers.\n\nThis way we don't need the `{repeat}` command anymore।"
