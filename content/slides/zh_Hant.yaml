                The second code that you can use in level 1 is `{ask}`.

                `{ask}` is used to ask a question that can be answered.
            code: |-
                {print} Welcome to your own rock scissors paper!
                {ask} What will you choose?

                The final text code that you can use in level 1 is `{echo}`.

                `{echo}` is used to repeat the answer of an `{ask}`.
            code: |-
                {print} Hello!
                {ask} What is your name?
                {echo} hello
        5:
            header: '{echo}'
            text: |-
                with `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
                This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.

            text: '`{forward}` is used to move the turtle forward.'

                We can also set a variable by asking questions.

                The answer to the question is stored in the variable.

                This way we don't need the `{echo}`  command.
        4:
            text: Now that we use variables, we can use multiple variables instead of just one `{echo}`command.
