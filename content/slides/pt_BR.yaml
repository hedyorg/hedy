                Programação é dar instruções para um computador, usando o idioma do computador

                Um idioma desses é chamado de uma "linguagem de programação"

                Talvez você já conheça algumas linguagems de programação?
                Alguns exemplos são:
                * Scratch
                * Python

                Se você pode programar, você pode fazer muitas coisas legais:
                * Construir histórias interativas
                * Criar desenhos digitais e desenha-los no papel ou em tecido
                * Criar seus próprios aplicativos para usar no seu celular

                O primeiro código que você pode usar no nível 1 é `{print}`.

                Você pode mudar o texto depois do comando de imprimir para o que você quiser.

                The final text code that you can use in level 1 is `{echo}`.

                `{echo}` is used to repeat the answer of an `{ask}`.

                with `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.

                When variable names are used in the middle of a sentence, you have to leave the variables out of the quotation marks.
                The rest of the sentence however, does need quotation marks. That looks like this:

                You might have noticed that your lines can get very long when you have both an `{if}` and an `{else}` command.

                If you have practised with the `{if}` and `{else}` commands, you can also try the `{in}` command.

                With `{in}` you can let the computer check if an item is in a list, for example:

                Please note that Hedy is case sensitive. This means that if you answer "Green" instead of "green", Hedy will print "meh".

                In this level you'll learn how to use functions. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again. To create a function, use define and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the define line. Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use call with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.
            header: Functions!
        5:
            text: |-
                In this program you see an example of a function.

        6:
            text: |-
                As you could see in the example a function is a block of code that can be called anytime. You use `{define}` to set the function and `{call}` to use it.
            header: Functions

                We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two ifs but can use and and or.
                From now on you could also use arguments in your functions.
            header: Welcome to level 13
        2:
            text: |-
                The `{and}` command is always used in a combination with the {if} command.
                This way you can check if 2 statements are true. For example:
            editor: <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/and_or_command/13/raw"></iframe>
            header: The and command
        3:
            text: |-
                The `{or}` works in the same way as the `{and}` command, but only 1 of the two statements has to be true.

                Let's see what happens when you change the `{and}` for `{or}`.
            editor: <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/and_or_command/13/raw"></iframe>
            header: The or command

            text: |-
                Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an **argument**. An argument is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.
            header: Functions with arguments
        5:
            text: |-
                In this example you see how the argument 'place' is used in the function.
                Run the code and change 'ocean' and 'sea' to something else, and see what happens.
            header: Example
            editor: <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/functions/13/raw"></iframe>
        6:
            text: |-
                Now you've ssen how arguments work, you could also combine function with a question.

                What happens if you make these changes:
                ```
                define song with place
                    print 'My Bonnie is ' place

                answer is ask 'Where is my Bonnie?'
                call song with answer
                ```
            header: Example with variable
            editor: <iframe class="fragment" src="/adventure/functions/13/raw"></iframe>
        7:
            text: |-
                Now we have combined even more question with the function. Type this code and see what happens.

                Note how the variables and the arguments have the same name. This is allowed.
                Does it confuse you? Just use different names, that is allowed as well.
                ```
                define song with name, place
                    print 'My ' name ' is ' place

                name is ask 'Who?'
                place is ask 'Where are they?'
                call song with name, place
                ```

                In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
