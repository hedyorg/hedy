    """Data from a YAML file, accessible as if it is a dictionary.

    Use like so:

        file = YamlFile.for_file('path/to/file.yaml')

        if file.exists():
            print(file['key1'])
        else:
            print('oh no')

    Since loading the YAML files tends to be slow (takes 1s to load all YAML
    files for a single language in the course of rendering the main code editor page),
    we do some caching work:

    - Caches the loaded data in memory, on the Flask 'current request globals' object.
      This means that accessing the same file twice in the same request will only load
      it once. If we don't do this, loading YAMLs takes 2s instead of 1 because of the
      duplicate loads.
      - To keep the application memory footprint low, we don't cache the data
        permanently, but drop it after the request is done.
    - After we have successfully loaded a YAML file, we write a pickled version
      of that YAML file to disk, so that we can load the pickled version faster in
      the future future  (loading pickled data is ~400x faster than parsing a YAML
      file).
      - Pickled files are purely a server-side optimization. The files should not be checked
        in, and in fact by default this class will only generate them when running on Heroku.
      - Nevertheless, we do some time stamp checking to make sure to read the pickle
        file if its timestamp is older than the YAML file's timestamp.
