"""Shared helper functions for the snippet tester functionality.

This code is there to test the code examples in all YAML files.

This file has been put together quickly to solve a problem. It can be cleaned up.

TODO:
- The collection routines are very similar; combine them.
- Snippets can hold on to the information where in the YAML file they were
  discovered. That way, individual test suites don't have to supply a
  'yaml_locator'.
