# Status of Things
This page presents an overview of content in different languages. If you want to translate hedy to a new language, this is a good list to follow.

Please add your name in the table when you want to work on a specific thing, so others can focus on stuff that has not been started on yet. Something will get a 'V' after the pull requests gets accepted and the content is merged to the `main` branch. Or, with the youtube-content, when the video is recorded and ready for uploading. Or, with the youtube-subtitling, when the subtitles are accepted and online. Happy coding/writing!

## Coding Environment
Texts in the coding environment, such as error messages, are stored in [texts.json](static/texts.json).

In addition to the generic texts, the coding environment has three pages: code, explanation and videos.

### Code
Code texts are taken form the [levels file](static/levels.json), which also controls which levels are available in the interface. Only when a level is present in a given language, it will be possible to access it in the website.

Our videos now have no subtitles, but in lieu of videos in other languages, the English ones could also be subtitled. This task has not been started yet.
