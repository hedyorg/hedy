Welcome to offline Hedy! You can use offline Hedy to run Hedy on your own
computer, and it can be used by anyone on the same network.


For you
=======

When you first start up offline Hedy on a Windows computer, two things can
happen:

- Windows Firewall will ask you whether or not to allow network connections.
  You should click "Allow".
- Windows Defender may say that Hedy is a dangerous program and ask you whether
  or not it should be run. You should clikc "Allow".

You can create a teacher account for yourself by visiting the following link:

    http://localhost/invite/newteacher


For students
============

When Hedy starts up, it will print a web address made from numbers. Your students
should type this address into the address bar of their browser.

The address will look something like this, but it will be different on every
computer. It can also change every time your computer starts up:

    http://192.168.31.13/


Upgrading to a newer version
============================

All your data and your student's data is stored in the file `database.json`
that you will see in the program's directory. When you download a newer version
of Offline Hedy it will come with its own empty database. To keep all programs
around, you can copy over the `database.json` file from the old version to the
new version of Hedy.

To keep it simple, you can also start fresh and use the newer version only for a
different class or different year.
